# Data Accuracy:

The accuracy and integrity of scraped data may be compromised by inconsistencies or errors on source websites structure. Implementing more robust and dynamic web scraping techniques and more advanced data validation and verification mechanisms can help ensure the reliability of information presented to users.

# Data timeliness:

The timeliness of data presented may be compromised by content changes on source websites. Update the backend JSON file on a monthly basis (ideally bi-weekly basis) can help improve the timeliness of the API endpoint query result by users.
