        "Abstract": "Assured Information Security, Inc. and Tufts University, propose CURE, an effort that will perform novel transfer learning research to enable the practical application of Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) for widescale use in both military and commercial systems. CURE is a research effort to investigate and develop novel and effective transfer RL techniques based on world-models that learn to disentangle what is common and what is not between domains in the form of common embedding spaces. This approach is inspired by recent work in image and style transfer, where learning these common embedding spaces has produced strikingly effective transfer and generalization of images from one style domain to another. Unlike traditional transfer RL approaches that attempt to learn how to generalize and adapt individual policies from one domain to another, CURE will develop methods to learn disentangled embeddings, which are latent models of two domains that explicitly represent what is shared between the domains and what is not. By modeling what is shared between domains, instead of what is shared between policies, CURE will enable broader and more effective transfer through improved domain adaptation and cross-domain planning. CURE will use these disentangled embeddings to develop transfer-aware policy learning algorithms that actively use knowledge of shared embeddings to effectively boost transfer and generalization across domains. Additionally, CURE will use the shared embeddings and examples of positive and negative transfer to train a metric model to predict transfer success. Such a metric could provide a principled and effective method for determining the degree to which two domains can transfer policies from one to another. Finally, CURE proposes novel research building upon our team\u2019s pioneering work in curriculum learning for effective transfer in complex multi-task domains."

        "Abstract": "Trust and assurance of Artificial Intelligence\/Machine Learning (AI\/ML) based systems is still, to a large degree, a research topic. Currently, the state of research in trusted AI\/ML is far from a state where we can, for example, prove that a non-trivial system behaves exactly as expected or where an AI\/ML based system is able to explain, in detail, how it comes to a decision and therefore can fully be trusted. In the proposed work, our goal is to achieve a level of trust similar to standard, algorithmic and programmatic systems based on methods, techniques and tools we can use in practically relevant systems and embedded in the relevant modern development approaches. What we can expect is that AI\/ML based systems meet well defined and realistic requirements and provide specific functionality within a given error rate. In the proposed work and as a short-term solution, we want to improve trust in these pattern matching related aspects of our system, which already is a very challenging undertaking. It not only includes specific AI\/ML aspects, but also the system architecture as a whole, and its security and safety aspects. We propose to build on and extend our prior work where we mainly have to bring together two main threads: trust analysis and risk management in complex systems, and AI\/ML in cybersecurity, in order to build an integrated solution for trust and assurance analysis and management in AI\/ML based, complex systems. Our method and tool will be fully integrated into a model based, CI\/CD and DevSecOps methodology and process, which we are already internally using for the development of our own systems. Our AITRUST solution has to be platform and system agnostic. This requires a highly flexible and adaptive risk management platform, which can integrate into different application platforms and AI\/ML systems, as well as cover cybersecurity and AI\/ML trust and risk aspects in an integrated and uniform way. Therefore, instead of building a monolithic trust analysis tool, we propose to apply the DevSecOps\/CI\/CD concepts to the AITRUST solution itself. We propose to implement the functionality of AITRUST as reusable, containerized microservices and to reuse cybersecurity\/AI\/ML functionality, both during development and at runtime as much as possible, whether they\u2019re already deployed in legacy systems or a part of applications platforms, containers and systems. This includes exploration, testing and scanning functionality, analysis of explainability and interpretability, and an agile graphical user interface that supports developers at different skill levels. A specific focus of the proposed work are trusted training data and baselines for anomalies detection. Our integrated AITRUST solution and tool will greatly improve the development of trusted AI\/ML systems."

        "Abstract": "U.S. Coast Guard personnel monitoring radio transmissions of vessels at sea must be able to identify distress calls despite interference, degraded conditions, and the stressed speech of those in emergency situations. However, not all distress calls are genuine. Hoax calls can be intended as malicious pranks, due to intoxication, or to distract Coast Guard assets from other tasks such as drug interdiction, and can be difficult to identify.Because responding to false emergencies is costly and can distract from attending real emergencies and on-going missions, researchers have explored automated techniques for hoax detection. Detection of deceptive speech is an active research area, but approaches to-date suffer limitations including the quality of available distress call datasets, the need for large quantities of speech to analyze linguistic structure, degraded audio, and the difficulty of assessing psychological states from voice recordings.Eduworks Corporation proposes to overcome these limitations with Distress Evaluation: Situational Cueing, Alerting and Monitoring (DE-SCAM). We will develop a proof-of-concept DE-SCAM prototype applying acoustic forensics based on our work in Artificial Intelligence\/Machine Learning (AI\/ML) - based speech processing. DE-SCAM will demonstrate continuous monitoring of radio voice transmissions, analyze the communication for potential hoaxes or fake distress calls, and provide analytic capabilities to profile the voice of the speaker with respect to characteristics such as possible intoxication, accent, and matches against previous hoax profiles. This work will benefit tactical response teams that rely on radio communications for timely incident response, and has potential to benefit telephonic voice communications as well."

        "Abstract": "The US Coast Guard (USCG) Search and Rescue (SAR) program\u2019s mission is to prevent loss of life in every situation where actions or resources could possibly be brought to bear. Because of this serious obligation, the USCG expends resources to pursue all distress notifications until they can be identified as a hoax. Sector Communications Unit (CU) watchstanders typically spend 12- hour watches listening mostly to radio static, which can lead to calls being missed. Further, when a distress call is received, it can be difficult to determine its authenticity. In this Phase I effort Sonalysts, Inc. will conduct research and development of the Heuristic-Optimized Analysis of Xmissions (HOAX) system, a human-centered Artificial Intelligence (AI) that will augment watchstander capabilities rather than seek to replace them. We will fuse various streams of data in addition to the voice transmission itself to provide watchstanders with classifications of critical cues (e.g. slurred speech or laughter), rather than a binary \u201cactual\u201d or \u201choax\u201d classification that must be accepted or rejected in totality. AI models will aid OPCEN watchstander sensemaking by helping them understand if certain cues are present or absent, while providing various overlays of additional geospatial data. To achieve this vision we will start by conducting user research with CU watchstanders, SAR Mission Coordinators (SMC), Sector OPCEN Chiefs, and Sector Commanders to identify critical cues used in hoax determination. We will conduct formative analytics to see which of these cues can be reliably classified to shape a research plan for Phase II."

        "Abstract": "Counterfeit microelectronics are a growing concern in the global electronics market. Most counterfeit inspection techniques are based on electrical testing, which is labor-intensive, time consuming, and requires a subject matter expert to develop the test and analyze the results. Another method is physical inspection and the use of advanced imaging instruments, e.g., X-ray, IR imaging microscopes, however they are not commercially available as a low-cost solution. Such challenges make these techniques impractical to use by a field agent who is on a remote-site, away from major facilities, and with limited expertise. The proposed work, Fast and Accurate Detection of Counterfeit Microelectronics (FACT) by Caspia Technologies will develop a system that utilizes a handheld device capable of rapidly and non-invasively detecting counterfeit microelectronics using optical imagery to be used by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents located at U.S. Ports of Entry (POEs). The handheld device, (such as a cell phone or camera), is connected to a software package on the cloud that is running artificial intelligence and machine learning framework for automated counterfeit analysis. This real-time system architecture is quick and easy-to-use for operators with no imaging nor testing expertise. For Phase I, Caspia Technologies will develop and demonstrate a design concept for FACT using state-of-the-art image processing and machine learning methods that will be adapted for microelectronic anomaly detection. We will also produce a final report evaluating the feasibility of the framework. The proposed activities will progress commercialization goals of offering a cost-effective, accurate, non-invasive, real-time counterfeit detection system."

These scientists and practitioners work at monitoring for conditions leading to, working through, and recovering from disastrous events. They currently use state-of-the-art sensors capable of detecting hazardous gases and chemical hazardous materials, which these sensors are individually calibrated for.Such sensor devices are in effect mobile lab stations, miniaturized, and target specific chemical toxin detectors.For the phase 1 study, Caelum has assembled a team of physicists and data scientists with experience in spectrometry and full-stack AI solutions development. Caelum Research Corporation has selected Spectromatics, LLC for its specific expertise as a subcontractor. We will develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform to augment and integrate into currently existing commercial chemical detectors produced by such firms as Honeywell, Ventis and ALTAIR. Our goal is to significantly increase the capacity and proficiency of these devices by adding AI capabilities through computational spectral analysis. We have aligned our vision with SBIR\u2019s three phases. Phase 1: feasibility of spectral data and AI algorithms, Phase 2: functional prototype, and Phase 3: operational commercialization. Such computational analysis using AI increases the flexibility, capability and adaptability of toxin detection, as new toxins are discovered throughout the platform\u2019s lifecycle. Our comprehensive and versatile AI algorithm, once implemented, will help multiple agencies and many of their commercial partners in the field of detection and mitigation of chemical hazards."

        "Abstract": "Tensors are fundamental building blocks in a wide range of high-performance computer applications including Artificial Intelligence (e.g., Deep Neural Networks) and Numerical Model and Simulation (e.g., Finite Element codes). High Performance Computer platforms are increasingly heterogeneous, with upcoming exascale platforms using heterogeneous processors (e.g., Intel Sapphire Rapids, Nvidia Grace, AMD EPYC processors) that include vector engines, matrix engines, and heterogeneous cores coupled with compute accelerators from a variety of vendors (e.g., Intel Xe HPC\/Ponte Vecchio, Nvidia A100, AMD MI100). Developing applications that can compile and run efficiently across the wide range of computer environments is a massive challenge. Tools such as Kokkos and KokkosKernels help reduce the burden, but they currently lack a performance portable tensor library. The proposed project will develop an optimized KokkosTensor API that supports tensor transpose, tensor contractions, as well as optimization of tensor expressions involving tensor contraction and other element- wise tensor operators. The implementations will utilize the Kokkos primitives to enable performance portable codes, will leverage high-performance vendor libraries where they exist (e.g., cuTensor), and will include architecture-aware tuned implementations where appropriate (e.g., Nvidia, AMD, and\/or Intel accelerators). The Phase I effort will develop a prototype KokkosTensor implementation that includes tensor contraction and tensor transpose. The library will support multiple GPU architectures and will be demonstrated using existing Kokkos finite element applications. KokkosTensor will be beneficial to many DOE and commercial applications, such as higher-order finite element discretizations that are being used in hypersonic reentry, mechanics, and fire simulations at Sandia. There are other examples in solvers for matrix-free multigrid methods and several other use cases across."

        "Abstract": "Cloud cover is an important but poorly characterized component of current climate models. In particular, there is a need to detect and quantify cloud cover in a physically meaningful manner. This need has led to the development of infrared cloud imagers. This system uses long-wave infrared cameras to observe the thermal emission from the clouds and produces a measurement of spatially distributed cloud cover, cloud optical depth, and cloud radiative forcing independent of solar illumination. However, previous systems have been maintenance intensive, dependent on co-located instruments, and required integrated calibration sources. The dependence on co-located instruments comes from the need to model clear sky emission to separate cloud emission from sky emission. These problems have limited their utility as field-deployable instruments. The proposed project will make the infrared cloud imaging systems self-contained by adding onboard metrology instruments and incorporating artificial intelligence to build a hybrid artificial intelligence and radiometric processing system. These advancements will result in a robust and fully autonomous cloud imaging system that will provide the required radiometric cloud data. Furthermore, this approach will enable these instruments to deploy to any site increasing their utility and economic value. In Phase I, an atmospheric model based on global radiosonde launches will be built along with methods to modify this model in real-time by independently detecting clear sky. Work will also develop a suite of sensors required for model inputs, including precipitable water vapor derived from a global positioning system receiver. Artificial intelligence methods will remove the human from the loop by detecting and correcting for ground objects on the horizon and spots on the lens. The commercial potential for cloud imaging exists within climate science but also extends beyond. Any system significantly impacted by clouds are potential markets which include situational awareness at airports, solar power generation, and Earth to space optical communication."

        "Abstract": "The Office of Science of Advanced Scientific Research (ASCR) invested heavily into various HPC software packages, which focus on the DOE mission, but need specialization and enhancements to make them deployed into high-impact industrial applications. Examples of such applications are optical computing for HPC and its subset, optical neural nets for Deep Learning. Optical computing has a potential to be much faster and more power-efficient than traditional computers. The design of optical computing systems faces two main challenges: low precision of photonic circuits due to high losses and parasitic effects; and their significant packaging problems. There is no simulation tool, which is readily available to photonic designers and capable to address these challenges. In Phases I and II, Tech-X Corporation will extend VSim software (funded by ASCR and other DOE offices) for the needs of the simulating and designing high-precision and compact optical computers and neural nets. VSim will (1) provide bi-directional integration with foundries databases; (2) have a means to generate and vary 2D and 3D layouts of photonic circuits; (3) simulate manufacturing variations, (4) be capable to create and model large circuits for optical computing, as well as accept and create parametric cells (PCells); (5) be extended for scans and optimization of imported and created geometries, (6) offer advanced diagnostics for the circuits and nets performance; (7) augment foundry design rules for optimized structures; (8) be integrated into a foundry design flow. In addition to developing new simulation capabilities, we plan to collaborate with photonic designers to do layout and fabrication of circuits designed using new software. In Phase I, Tech-X will address the feasibility to analyze and mitigate the effects of manufacturing variations on the performance of photonic circuits. In particular, Tech-X will (1) introduce a means to simulate sidewall roughness of optical components (with the statistical distribution available from the literature) and save geometries in GDS2 and STL formats; (2) enable ensemble simulations with the parametric and statistical geometry variations (distances, curvatures and roughness); and (3) test new capabilities by performing sensitivity analysis of sample photonic circuits to roughness and geometry variations. Simulation results will consist of the 3D distributions of EM fields in time domain in HDF5 format and S parameters in frequency domain in HDF5 format, visualizable in VisIt. All capabilities will be expressed to users through an easy-to-use Graphical User Interface. The proposed software will be available to multiple researchers in the national laboratories and universities performing research on photonic devices, as well as be available to industrial concerns involved in the manufacture of such devices. Commercial applications include: Artificial Intelligence for Big Data and Autonomous Vehicles, optical computing in general, telecommunications and bio-sensors."

        "Abstract": "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tools are increasingly being used to solve complex problems across diverse applications. While these tools are being routinely used for domains with high volumes of data, they have not deeply integrated into heterogenous data of the complex sciences. Furthermore, humans play a critical role in validation of data truth that models learn from, as well as validating those models have learned the correct unbiased concepts from the data. Typically, subject matter experts are highly knowledgeable about their specific domain of interest (particle physics, viral genomics etc.), but do not have the resources to hand curate large-scale datasets necessary to make their data Artificial Intelligence-ready. Labeling data to make it Artificial Intelligence-ready reduces time and complexity to build Machine Learning models, allowing scientists to apply their domain knowledge at scale to new data points. Using a cloud-hosted solution with a web interface, subject matter experts will provide annotations in a customizable user interface that is domain dependent (image viewer, graph selection tools, sequence annotation tools, geospatial map, etc.) and the platform will learn from annotations to apply machine labels to new data points with high confidence. Through active learning, the platform will only ask the expert to focus on data points that provide the highest value for the learning algorithm. Over time the models will pre-annotate data to the user for review, and eventually reach a point where they can self-annotate with confidence. Phase I will result in building and testing, a scientific machine learning assisted data annotation platform to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach focused on systems biology and bioenergy applications. It is anticipated that biological systems such as plant and microbial systems data, especially relevant to sustainable energy will be able to use this platform. Innovations in life sciences, from sequencing data to advanced imaging data to SARS-CoV-2 data have implications for the greater good for the public and therefore the economy as well. Once the core learning approach is developed during Phase I, only minor modifications on the user interface will be required to apply to new scientific application areas. This will be the focus of Phase II integrating the platform to areas such as Chemical, Geochemical, and Biogeochemical data."

        "Abstract": "GCSS-A is of critical importance in supporting Army supply, maintenance, and logistics operations, in addition to serving as the financial system of record. The current GCSS-A implementation has a cumbersome user experience and user interface and does not provide machine learning\/artificial intelligence capabilities to support modern day command, maintenance, and supply operations. We propose to build on our prior experience with data pipelines, machine learning, procurement\/inventory management, and modern user application design to deliver a functional extension to GCSS-A by the completion of Phase I. Capabilities include, but are not limited to, improved data validation and user input, enhanced data visualization, and machine learning methods to support Mission-Based Forecasting (MBF). The proposed Phase I work includes: 1) Integration of representative data into the data pipeline for visualization, exploration, and model development. The data pipeline provides for automated data cleaning and reconciliation of disparate data sources, 2) Conducting user workshops with stakeholders via SPARTN-referenced soldier touchpoints. 3) Iterating on user workflows (including data entry) and application functionality through regular deployments of new prototype functionality, and 4) Training and validating machine learning models to support data quality and to provide decision support for mission\/exercise planning (including asset selection, preparation, and mobilization). The proposed work is aligned with our existing efforts with the US Marine Corps. Specifically, we are working to extend the functionality of GCSS-MC using machine learning and with an improved application interface. Prior experience includes the application of machine learning to predict work requests, equipment operational status, and unit readiness."

        "Abstract": "The proposed Hermes system combines multiple TRL9 technologies currently in operation within the U.S. Army and DoD into a highly capable obstacle detection and avoidance system for tethered UAS and ground vehicles. The Hermes system leverages a TRL9 obstacle detection and 3D mapping system in use for manned helicopters operating in degraded visual environments to guide the algorithm and sensor selection to create a high-assurance 3D world model at long ranges to allow the tethered UAS sufficient time to mitigate the detected obstacles. Obstacle avoidance and path planning approaches are informed by TRL9 autonomous control and planning capabilities developed for manned and unmanned aerial systems; to include multiple collaborative aerial systems connected by a tether analog. These TRL9 technologies will be used to inform the selection of sensors and guide the software and sensor architecture to meet the requirements of the tactical environment. Developing the architecture of the Hermes system will leverages the team\u2019s vast expertise in developing sensor and software systems for airborne systems, airborne control of multiple interconnected systems, modular\/open software architecture, data assurance, artificial intelligence, manned-unmanned teaming\/collaborative robotics, and machine learning. These efforts will also be supported by the team\u2019s working knowledge of ROS\/ROS2 to align with the Phase 2 simulation environment and their experience developing open system hardware and software solutions for the DoD for Phase 3 and beyond. This collection of knowledge and experiences drastically reduces the risk associated with the development of the Hermes obstacle detection and avoidance system for tethered UAS and ground vehicle system."

        "Abstract": "The Army depends on radiographic inspection for non-destructive testing (NDT) of munitions and armaments to identify defects before these products reach the warfighter. Highly skilled and experienced radiographers must interpret the inspection results. This process is not only laborious and time consuming, but also subjective and inconsistent. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) opens the opportunity to develop an automated system to identify potential defects to aid the interpretation of the results and expedite the inspection process. During Phase I, Sky Park Labs demonstrated DeepNDT, a suite of machine learning algorithms that assist a radiographer in the interpretation of radiographic inspection results by automatically identifying, quantifying, and visualizing potential defects and flaws. DeepNDT uses unsupervised and supervised deep learning algorithms for automatically detecting anomalies and highlights any deviations as potential defects. Then, the system classifies the defect type and characterizes its geometry and size for a radiographer to assess and make a final decision. These algorithms were evaluated on government-furnished data and various industrial datasets, achieving real-time performance and accuracy, precision, and recall rates of over 95% for detection and classification tasks. Phase II will focus on the development of all aspects of the technology into a fully functional prototype software tool integrated into the inspection workflow. The resulting technology has the potential to reduce the cognitive load on a level II NDT technician and thereby increase the efficiency and accuracy of the assessment of parts for defects."

        "Abstract": "Design Interactive Inc. proposes the further development of Military Information Superiority Technology (MISTec), an adaptive, automated information prioritization and management system that facilitates optimal usage of networking and computing resources for promoting operational situational awareness (SA) in modernized command conditions. MISTec uses a customized, scalable Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven algorithm to watch, evaluate, and prioritize the mass of relevant information from disparate sources so Soldiers can observe, orient, decide, and act faster than the adversary despite the reduction in physical resources and computing power associated with mobile command posts (CPs) of the future. The focus of Phase I was to establish the theoretical and computational foundation for the algorithms. This enabled MISTec to demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness across an initial data set and an associated mission command scenario. The proposed Phase II research will directly extend Phase I results, enhancing the foundational algorithms through extending the Goal Directed Task Analysis (GDTA), generating enhanced scenarios, and validating the algorithms leading to the development a staged prototype and a Technology Effectiveness Evaluation. By the end of Phase II, MISTec will be a commercially viable information prioritization tool."

        "Abstract": "Physical Sciences Inc. proposes to mature a suite of artificial intelligence algorithms developed to discriminate airborne chemical\/biological warfare agent plumes from battlefield clutter in standoff light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data. The AI-assisted LIDAR clutter mitigation (ALCM) system tracks all plume-type objects within the LIDAR field of regard, and employs a two-stage classification algorithm to quantify the probabilistic threat level of each plume. The ALCM utilizes a convolutional neural network to identify and characterize plumes in each LIDAR scan based on shape and concentration profile. Additional confidence refinement is achieved through characterization of plume properties such as airborne mass and dissipation rate by performing temporal analysis of subsequent LIDAR scans using DisperseNET. The DisperseNET algorithm is PSI\u2019s real-time dispersion modeling algorithm. The prototype ALCM system demonstrated a 92% probability of threat detection and classification at an average of 301 LIDAR scans between false track output in the Phase I. The primary objective of the proposed effort is to improve and operationalize the ALCM capability through enhancement of the DisperseNET simulation engine, expansion of the training and validation datasets, and demonstration of the ALCM capability through the production of a ruggedized processing module for LIDAR integration."

        "Abstract": "Today, crucial large-scale infrastructure is typically monitored by manual patrols\u2014two guys in a pickup truck. As a result, the systems that underpin everyday life including military bases, power infrastructure, and fire-prone wildlands suffer from gaps in coverage, long response times, and high operating costs. Our Phase I feasibility study demonstrated that end-users across theaters and enterprise programs have a mission need for a lower-cost and more scalable solution for distributed ground surveillance over vast areas, both domestically and abroad. Legacy ground surveillance systems lag behind the private sector in the use of artificial intelligence, are built as siloed IT systems that do not support real-time distributed decision making, and each unit costs millions of dollars which makes them unsuitable for long-term deployments at large scale. The Air Force will address that mission need by adapting Picogrid\u2019s existing commercial technology as a defense-specific variant: Platform for Active Protection and Reconnaissance (PAPR). PAPR combines highly scalable, cloud-native C5ISR software and artificial intelligence with low-cost ground-based surveillance hardware to deliver cost effective ground surveillance over wide areas. Through its innovative communications system, PAPR enables over-the-horizon transmission and independent operation across thousands of locations. The objective of the proposed effort is to ruggedize and optimize the commercial variant for Air Force\u2019s requirements to deliver highly resilient ground based surveillance over wide, remote, and hostile areas for approximately one-tenth of the cost of existing alternatives."

The annotated attributes will also be used to build on research conducted at Ellsworth AFB on the deterioration of paved surfaces by a combination of liquids that drip or leak from aircraft and extreme temperatures as had been observed and studied by the installation. Moreover, the state-of-the-art deep convolutional networks (DCNs) and semi-supervised AI training processes to be employed as part of this R&amp;D program will allow for the automated development of lists with the types of aircraft types that can land at each location based on site-specific conditions and input from Air Force SMEs. Athenium Analytics IRIS and Gauge solutions, which will be used as part of this program,\u00a0are assessed at a defense technical readiness level of seven (7). As part of the proposed Phase II R&amp;D program, Athenium Analytics will address Air Force-specific use-cases by training existing and new artificial intelligence-driven algorithms (\u201cbots\u201d) to identify surface or infrastructure features leveraging high-resolution imagery and IRIS\u2019 tested R&amp;D workflows. Athenium Analytics\u2019 Phase I feasibility discussions with Malmstrom and Ellsworth AFBs were generated from Athenium Analytics\u2019 work program with AFIMSC, whereby the parties explored additional AI\/ML capabilities and use cases similar to such work that could benefit new Air Force stakeholders and end users. As part of ongoing work with AFIMSC and AFCEC, Athenium Analytics delivered structural condition, damageability &amp; natural hazard risk assessments for approximately 80,000 buildings across 100 Air Force installations within five (5) months, using artificial intelligence applied to aerial imagery &amp; without on-site visits. This effort, which focused on roof condition, involved the segmentation of multi-section roofs as inventoried by the Air Force, with assessments provided at the section-level. The success and advances achieved under the roof assessment program prompted feasibility discussions for a pilot that would adapt Athenium Analytics capabilities for the automated of road, runways and paved surface assessments in and around Malmstrom and Ellsworth AFBs. For the proposed R&amp;D program under an SBIR Phase II, Athenium Analytics has partnered with Malmstrom AFB and with Ellsworth AFB. More specifically, the proposed program will be undertaken directly with Malmstrom AFB\u2019s 341st Civil Engineering Squadron of the 341st Mission Support Group &amp; Ellsworth AFB\u2019s 28th Civil Engineering Squadron of the 28th Mission Support Group."

        "Abstract": "Smart Cities are everywhere. Foreign municipalities implement thousands of monitoring sensors to enable infrastructure management and population surveillance. This global trend in Smart City technology spending will only continue to increase, already growing from 81 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 to 189.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2023 (Statista). Of this amount, only 26% of global spending on Smart City technology initiatives is in the United States (Statista). On the contrary, China is currently deploying approximately 800 Smart City programs (Otonomo). As a result, Smart City infrastructure has become a severe threat vector on the urban battlefield. The reality of Smart City infrastructure, Ubiquitous Technical Surveillance (UTS), and commercial smart devices necessitate an immediate change in Special Operations Forces urban battlefield planning. Special Operations Forces need new ways to effectively conduct operations in Smart City environments that counter the malicious use of UTS, artificial intelligence (AI)\/machine learning (ML), and Data Analysis. These new methods will need to be rapidly deployable in urban environments to model known Smart City and UTS elements, providing operators near-real-time feedback. This critical information will guide their ability to combat, circumvent, and exploit Smart City infrastructure for effective mission execution. Cities like Taipei, Shenzhen, Hong Kong, and St. Petersburg all have a Smart City infrastructure throughout, including their urban maritime port areas and other critical infrastructure. The Certus Deployable Smart City Range solution will provide Special Operations with the flexible and agile training ranges and methodologies required for this critical mission. This solution will provide a mobile, easily deployable, and efficiently acquired system tailored to many complex environmental factors. The Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution will include a Mobile and Deployable Range that contains sensors and actuators commonly found in Smart Cities. A Range Control will monitor trainee progress within a Fixed Lab tailored for urban and maritime environments. This system permits new sensor testing, data aggregation, and visualization components seamlessly integrating into the range. Advanced algorithm solutions enable range control to deploy their own AI\/ML in real-time on streaming Smart City IoT data to gain insight into these systems and the operator&apos;s behavior. As a result of careful engineering decisions, operational training for this effective PaaS solution is exceptionally approachable. Certus Group was born out of the idea that transformational innovation is needed in many industries if we\u2019re going to be able to meet the challenges ahead of us in the next two decades. Innovation, redefined is what we do."

        "Abstract": "The software used in High Performance Computing (HPC) and Artificial Intelligence\/Machine Learning (AI\/ML) workloads is increasingly complex to maintain, install, and optimize. More problematic is the poor performance portability of applications between platforms, forcing site-specific re-engineering of codes. Existing solutions to deployment of AI\/ML workflows on commercial cloud environments are platform- specific, preventing migration from one cloud provider to another. This project proposes to address the problem by combining the use of E4S, which provides multi-platform container images, with MVAPICH2, a highly-performant and performance-portable MPI library for fast, inter-and intra- node communication on AWS and other commercial cloud platforms. Phase I will evaluate the feasibility of this solution and build prototypes for evaluation. We will evaluate the use of MVAPICH2 to provide high-performance deployments of MPI applications on cloud platforms; build high-performance versions of commonly used Deep Learning frameworks for cloud deployment; make use of high-speed network adapters and GPUs within the cloud environments; and evaluate the creation of a web interface for one-click deployment of highly performant Deep Learning applications. The success of our Phase I project will deliver a productive platform for transitioning important HPC applications (many developed in DOE national laboratories) to more accessible cloud based HPC platforms in a portable manner while retaining high performance. It will be beneficial to practically all scalable HPC applications ranging from modeling and simulation to AI\/ML, where advance message communication hardware and access to accelerator technologies are being more commonly supported in commercial cloud systems. In particular, data analytics and deep learning are areas of high growth and of benefit to a broad range of industries. High performance is critical for these codes \u2014 a poorly performing code wastes compute resources, preventing purchased hardware from being used for other uses, increasing a business\u2019s costs for cloud computing resources, and increasing time to solution. This project will especially benefit the deep learning market by making deployment of applications on cloud platforms easier, facilitating portability between cloud platforms while maintaining performance, and reducing training time for deep learning models. Efficient use of pay-per-core-hour resources like public clouds reduces costs to users along with energy consumption"

        "Abstract": "This proposal is for Phase II continuation of our project to develop a software framework for Calibration of Ethical Trust for Lethal Autonomous Weapons (CETLAWS) that can be used by Air Force, other DoD organizations and commercial enterprises. The mission impact of this project on the Department of the Air Force will be an enhanced understanding of the roles of ethics and trust in lethal autonomous systems and the availability of new methods to facilitate calibrated trust in human-autonomy teaming scenarios. Ethical trust calibration will increase military users\u2019 willingness to collaborate with lethal robotic technology and will also overlap with key commercial applications in trusted artificial intelligence (AI) and social computing. In Phase I of the present project, we demonstrated and validated an initial CETLAWS using a simulation of a swarm of autonomous lethal unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a set of ethical equations for making autonomous Shoot\/No-Shoot decisions. In Phase II we will implement a complete CETLAWS prototype using both ethical equations and Bayesian modeling for trust calibration, validate this prototype; and begin our transition and commercialization activities with an initial focus on insertion into DAF wargames and test events with the help and collaboration of our USMC end-user."

        "Abstract": "In response to the DOT\u2019s FY21 SBIR topic 21-FT2, Interphase Materials (IPM) proposes the development of a low-cost automated data collection system that uses machine learning (ML), a type of artificial intelligence (AI), to predict and alert transit agencies of biological and viral contamination risks making condition-based sanitization possible for more effective and efficient operations.The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the risk that bacteria and viruses pose to those that use public transportation and demonstrated the need for improvementin the current abilities of public transit agencies to monitor and reduce the risk of disease transmission on transit vehicles effectively and efficiently. IPM proposes to develop an ML model that takes readily available data, such as rider numbers, vehicle size, weather conditions, etc., and additional data from inexpensive sensors, such as aerosol samplers, to predict spikes in bacteria and virus growth on transit vehicles. This ML model will be used as a risk assessment tool to make informed and flexible condition-based sanitization schedules for transit vehicles to ensure rider safety while minimizing the cost of vehicle cleaning."

        "Abstract": "Proposal SummaryProject Title: Autonomous Robotic Scout and Precision Sprayer for High Density CitrusPD: Dr. Siddartha Mehta (proposed)PI: Dr. Tom Burks Univ. of FloridaCo-PI&apos;s: Dr. Bill Castle Emeritus UFAOR: Lee C. Jones President GeoSpider Inc.Numerous challenges face the Florida and U.S. citrus industries including global marketpressure urban and environmental pressures labor issues and emerging diseases and pests thusunderscoring the need for new production approaches. Over the last two decades over 200000acres of Florida citrus production has been lost due to the citrus canker eradication program andcitrus greening (HLB). HLB is now considered endemic in Florida and hundreds of thousands ofacres are in steep decline with minimal hope of finding remediation solutions. Long term hoperests on finding HLB resistant varieties and developing advanced management strategies that cancontrol the psyllid population repel them from groves and manage trees in an optimal economicframework. One approach being considered is Advanced Citrus Production Systems (ACPS)that use high density semi-dwarfed trees and open hydroponics with optimized nutrient and wateravailability which accelerates plant growth. When combined with HLB tolerant rootstocks theconcept seeks to increase yield production per acre while simultaneously shortening the time toreturn on investment which means that grove life can be shortened by disease pressure and stillremain economically viable. Another emerging commercially admitted production approach isCitrus Under Protective Screen (CUPS); CUPS uses high-density semi-dwarfed trees or pottedtrees to limit tree size due to canopy height limitations. Citrus under enclosed structures canexclude the Asian citrus psyllid and eliminate the negative effects of citrus greening to high valuevarieties like the grapefruit. However both of these new grove architectures will require newcompatible equipment systems to manage production and harvesting but they may createalternate crop disease and pest pressures that require precision spray control to manage.GeoSpider Inc has been developing both mass and selective harvesting technologies forhigh density ACPS. However we recognize that there is a signficant overlap between ACPS andCUPS not only in harvesting but also in sprayer related technologies. The citrus industry is facinga challenge with respect to a large number of disease and pests that require the use of expensivechemicals some of which require monthly application. With growing environmental pressures andconcerns over agricultural sustainability it will be crucial to develop more efficient autonomoustechnologies that can scout and map disease and pest pressures using artificial intelligence whichcan build prescription maps along with real-time canopy mapping to optimize sprayer efficacy andminimize overspray and drift which will result in environmental and economic benefits forproducers.In this Phase I project we will develop a scaled concept prototype to demonstrateautonomus navigation canopy mapping under screen localization and precision spraying withthe following specific objectives: 1) We will adapt an earlier greenhouse robot sprayer rig fordemonstration of autonomous navigation under canopy and spraying in CUPS while 2) a mannedJD Gator and a pull behind sprayer will be equipped with the sensory systems for scoutingnavigation canopy mapping and precision spraying using technologies developed during priorresearch. In addition 3) advanced concept design and modeling will be done for the full-scalePhase II robot scout and sensory suite. 4) Field tests will be conducted using the scaled Phase Iprototype at the Dundee CUPS facilities. In the planned Phase II project we will integrate thetechnology components from prior research and this Phase I project to build a commercial Ph"

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\/Abstract. The Company proposes to research the feasibility of reducingchemical insecticide and labor required while increasing the data collected using advancedimaging propietary artificial intelligence and attractants in monitoring detecting and managingagricultural pests over the 8-month project period. This research specifically targets Amyeloistransitella aka Navel Orangeworm (NOW) the primary pest in California almonds whichcauses more than $900M of annual losses. The SolaRid\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 product applies algorithms todetermine crop phenology and timing of insects biofix events while monitoring abioticconditions with sensors. It utilizes five interchangeable insect attractant modules to lure specifictargeted pests. Finally aproprietary artificial intelligence (AI) technology developed by anawarded National Science Foundation (NSF) grant is used to detect target species infestationscompleting a comprehensive analytic decision support system. More efficient insect control willresult from the quality of data analyzed by SolaRid allowing for reduced chemical insecticideuse by increasing the specificity and timeliness of the applied input. More finely attunedapplications in time and space will reduce residuals on produce and the amount of insecticides inour environment. EPA licensed agricultural Pest Control Advisors (PCA) are becoming moredependent on sensors and remotely generated data. SolaRid&apos;s use is consistent with this trendimproving the quality\/ accessibility of data saving up to 6 hours\/day of in-field monitoring datais available 24 hours\/7 days a week remotely.Project Objectives and a Description of the Effort. SolaRid will conduct the field trials withUC ANR. The objective is to test the AI technology to develop empirical data of the combinedtechnologies&apos; efficacy.The initial steps include setting up communication networks calibratingsensors and confirming protocols. Then while the device is being tested the Company will elicitproduct design and procedural recommendations from PCA&apos;s and producers. An example ofhow this process would work for adjusting the algorithm is broadly outlined at the end of theTechnical Objectives section. There are five research questions concerning validity benefits andperformance of the sensor outputs and procedures. Results are intended to create actionableintelligence for data driven management decisions developed during this phase I research.Inphase II the Company will continue to collaborate with its California partners to complete theinsect control device (ICD) creating a complete and sustainable turn-key solution. At the end ofphase II we will have multiple fully functional units to competently identify and count localinsects and identify key agricultural pests of high economic importance in nut orchard industry."

        "Abstract": "Our nation\u2019s investment in our nuclear power plants is extensive and valuable. However, high operating costs, relative to alternative technologies, threaten the economic viability our nuclear fleet. Operation and maintenance are labor intensive, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the operating cost of a nuclear plant. Artificial intelligence and machine learning can automate monitoring and planning to help optimize decision making and substantially lower operating costs.\nThe proposed solution creates a virtual expert that will continuously monitor each important item of equipment in the plant. This virtual expert never sleeps and will monitor and detect any abnormal changes in the operation of the equipment. When abnormal changes occur, the virtual expert will determine the most likely cause for the problem, based on the symptoms detected, and will propose the corrective action steps to resolve the problem with the lowest risk and cost. Additionally, the virtual expert will continuously estimate the remaining time available before the problem must be corrected to prevent the equipment from reaching an operating or maintenance limit, shutting down or failing.\nPhase I demonstrates feasibility of a Virtual Subject Matter Expert for the main steam turbine in a nuclear plant. Ultimately, the solution will entail a comprehensive library of these reusable virtual experts that is tailored and provided to equipment owners in nuclear power and other market segments. Three key innovations are integrated and verified in the project. These are 1) hybrid digital twin models for predicting the expected performance of the equipment while it is operating, 2) diagnostic decision models for evaluating any abnormal behavior and suggesting the best corrective action, and 3) prognostic models for accurately predicting the amount of time available to take a corrective action. These integrated models combine multiple artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to replicate the analysis methods used by human subject matter experts. The new innovations are built and demonstrated on top of an existing commercial software platform that is widely used across the power industry today for continuous online monitoring of plant equipment.\nThe primary benefit to the public will be lower electricity rates and lower CO2 emissions. Public utilities will benefit from lower operating costs and avoided capital costs to replace nuclear assets with new generating assets. Commercially, the project innovations have broad applicability across nearly all process industries. As an established provider of online monitoring systems to all types of power plants, oil and gas plants and other manufacturers, the company is well positioned to put these innovations into immediate commercial use as an extension of our existing product lines."

        "Abstract": "1 SITUATION BEING ADDRESSED\nOur nation\u2019s energy delivery system must be secure, resilient, and reliable. The transition to a modern grid will create new technical challenges for an electric power system that was not designed for today\u2019s requirements. This new world grid must enable remote renewable generation, a growing number of distributed energy resources, diversification, and smart, distributed, and secure grids.\nThe electric power grid is facing increasing stress due to fundamental changes in both supply-side and demand-side technologies. Our grid modernization is adding new forms of distributed generation, storage, and load capacity, higher density, bi-directional power flow, and far more interconnects to support growing demand. This increases the amount of power that can be supplied in any one branch. Therefore, all branch circuits must have their fault handing devices upgraded to handle the new higher fault current limit. This necessity leads to a fault current limiter (FCL). Mobile platforms also require a powerful and compact FCL.\n2 PROJECT APPROACH\nOur Benefit: Highest performing conventional and superconducting (SC) cable, magnet, and cable magnet products. This is done via: 1) Lower wind stress ? lower operational stress &amp; complex geometries ? Improved operational parameters; 2) Complex geometries ? lower operational stress ? Improved operational parameters; 3) Automated &amp; optimized winding ? Improved operational parameters &amp; lower cost. Our value proposition is allowing magnet &amp; cable magnet devices never before possible such as: 1) SC devices that were previously winding limited; 2) winding fully HTS &amp; reacted MTS products; 3) 2x to 500x performance improvement; 4) magnets with improved ramp rates (dB\/dt &amp; dI\/dt).\nOur revolutionary robotic manufacturing reduces stress via Artificial Intelligence (AI) for a Human Robot Interaction (HRI) which allows higher currents, lower cost, and complex and reliable magnet shapes to produce the first fully cold [both primary and secondary at liquid nitrogen (LN2) temperatures] high temperature superconducting (HTS), first combined inductive and resistive FCL, and first tiered FCL with the possibility of lessened to removed splice hot spots. ASCFCL is a passive alternating current (AC) (majority of the world grid), compact and simple design, low weight [air core &amp; less copper (Cu)], more reliable and less FCL and grid stressing since multi-tiered, high power FCL.\n3 PHASE I WORK EFFORT\nPhase I will develop automation benefits for winding a sub-scale HTS FCL for feasibility testing from normal operation to a fault condition. Phase II will develop and prove the commercial viability of a full-scale LN2 cooled, compact, multi-layer, combined inductive and resistive, air core, alternating current (AC) HTS FCL for minimum 10MVA at 10kV and will form the basis of higher power versions of ASCFCL. The device will be electrically passive, low impedance during normal operation, fast acting to respond within part of a cycle during a fault, and will recover under load. Over time and due to automation and quantity production, magnet fabrication and HTS material costs will naturally fall allowing an increased customer base.\n4 COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS AND OTHER BENEFITS\nOur civilization consumes greater amounts of power and in increasing electrical proportions. Existing global electrical infrastructure installed over a half century ago is past end of life and facing capacity problems. Nations without a grid infrastructure demand a grid. Utilities are moving beyond classical solutions with unprecedented speed to modernize the grid. This project addresses the needs of supporting the estimated world electricity consumption expected to double from 20 trillion kWh\/year today to more than 40 trillion kWh\/year by 2040. This project will result in commercial utility market technology advances and beyond."

        "Abstract": "Statement of the problem: For effective and equitable outcomes in achieving the national goal of\nnet-zero carbon emissions, communities must be included and even lead the implementation of innovative\ngreen-energy technologies. Collaborations with communities should happen through informed decision\nmaking, community-centered research, and engagement of stakeholders at the local, state, and regional\nlevels. Geothermal, like many new technologies whose social and economic impacts are not fully\nunderstood, often cause disproportionately high adverse effects on disadvantaged communities.\nObjective of the Phase I project: Our goal is to actively engage disadvantaged communities to develop a\nnovel web-based interactive software toolbox that provides everything needed for communities to better\nunderstand and develop their geothermal resources. We will bridge the gap between technology\nadvancements and community needs by facilitating the interactions between the geothermal industry,\nregulators, stakeholders, and end-users.\nWhat is to be done in Phase I: We will develop a Community Engagement Plan that will be designed to\nactively engage disadvantaged communities to represent their needs, expectations, and concerns regarding\ngeothermal resource development and utilization. Our work will merge data, computational tools,\nknowledge, expertise, and experience. Our novel software will expand the capabilities of existing tools\ndeveloped by us and others for data analytics, uncertainty quantification, sensitivity\/decision analyses,\ncloud computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits: Communities will not need to start at ground zero each\ntime they wish to improve the lives of their members if comprehensive and fail-safe tools that include\ndata knowledge, experience, and research are embedded early in the process. Our work will provide fast\nprocessing and dissemination of geothermal information to users and communities. Acknowledging the\nJustice40 Initiative, 40% of wages under this project are dedicated to members of unprivileged\ncommunities.\nThe social benefits of community-focused and enhanced geothermal development and utilization are\nnearly infinite. Our novel technology will help create high-quality jobs and help deliver affordable,\ncarbon pollution free energy across the country. Consequently, social justice and environmental\nimprovements are expected. By facilitating successful and cost-effective geothermal development, the\nindirect benefit includes a potential yet significant contribution toward the national goal of achieving\nnet-zero carbon emissions. Our product will also help communities and businesses to apply for funding\nresulting in more sustainable and efficient opportunities and enabling communities to maximize economic\nbenefits and revenue that promote more sustainable outcomes.\nOur Community Engagement Plan will provide tools for sustained and meaningful community\nengagement, thereby improving environmental and procedural justice for community stakeholders in the\ngeothermal system design and development process. It will also provide communities with the tools to\nmaximize economic outcomes and wealth building as a direct benefit of the technology deployment. Our\nnovel technology will provide advancements for planning with justice-focused outcomes ranging from\ncommunity benefits to the local workforce and businesses."

        "Abstract": "Nuclear reactors provide operators with hundreds of data channels that indicate the state of the reactor. During an accident, the flood of information from these channels can be overwhelming, making it difficult for operators to determine the correct actions to reduce the accident impact. Reactor accidents negatively impact public perception of nuclear power and the commercial nuclear industry as a whole.\nObjective: This project will generate an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that will have the capability to aggregate the available data from the reactor instrumentation and correctly identify the reactor condition. During an accident, the AI tool will be able to provide operators with information about the accident and the data that was used in that determination. This tool will help operators to respond correctly to reactor accidents and will also help inform better placement of instrumentation.\nPhase I Effort: Development and training of the AI system will commence in Phase I for a prototypical reactor event. Initially, the AI algorithm will be trained to recognize a range of loss of coolant accident (LOCA) events for a generic Westinghouse three-loop reactor unit. At this stage, the cases used to train the AI will be based on simulated data from thousands of reactor system simulations using an analysis code such as TRACE. Once trained, the AI system will be validated against its ability to correctly distinguish a LOCA event from non-LOCA events or normal reactor operations. A series of challenge scenarios will then be presented that include missing information simulating sensor failures in a reactor system. Output from the AI tool will include a confidence level regarding the event detection, along with an importance weighting to help identify the sensors with the most predictive value.\nCommercial Applications: The AI tool developed in Phases I, II, and III will be extremely valuable to nuclear utilities and will help operators to run nuclear plants more safely. Using deep learning neural networks to aggregate large volumes data and recognize patterns that reveal the potential for an accident prior to any excursion would help ensure the safe and reliable operation of reactor systems. An improved public perception of the safety of nuclear power would lead to increased likelihood of future nuclear plants being built, therefore reducing the overall climate impacts from fossil fuels."

        "Abstract": "Studies of laser-driven high energy density (HED) plasma physics require large, complex laser systems providing well-controlled pulses at extreme intensities reaching TW and PW levels. New facilities, several of which exist within the LaserNetUS consortium, have increased the operation rate of 10-100 TW laser sources to the 10 Hz regime, allowing thousands of HED experiments to be performed within minutes. The ability to collect large data sets will enable more thorough and robust data analysis, particularly by leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques. However, high fidelity HED plasma diagnostics are required at commensurate repetition rates to realize the full research potential of these facilities. While several plasma diagnostic techniques with high temporal resolution exist at 10 Hz, these methods are unable to temporally characterize a single HED plasma event. Since HED plasma diagnostics take place on ps \u2013 ns time scales, imaging techniques with GHz frame rates are required to track the evolution of HED plasmas; frame gating on the single ps level is also necessary to freeze plasma movement withing a single frame. The proposed imaging technique maintains ps-level temporal resolution while simultaneously capturing 2D plasma dynamics on 100 ps timescales. Furthermore, while the current proposal supports 10 Hz delivery of GHz imaging bursts, this delivery rate is only limited by the operation of the TW and PW lasers within the LaserNetUS network. Scaling delivery to kHz levels is possible through straightforward modifications of the laser probe source. Spectral Energies will leverage its industry leading laser diagnostics capabilities to develop a compact, turn-key system suitable for deployment at LaserNetUS facilities and future commercialization efforts. Dr. Enam Chowdhury at the Ohio State University will lead the implementation of the GHz frame rate HED plasma imaging source. His ultrafast laser laboratory will initially demonstrate the system\u2019s spatial and temporal resolution using laser generated plasmas with densities sufficient for comparison with those generated at multi-TW HED laboratories. Aside from the direct benefit to the Department of Energy related to GHz rate imaging of HED laser plasmas, this technology offers several robust commercialization pathways. There is significant potential for market adoption within the cold ablation and precision laser processing industry, particularly the multi-billion dollar optical display market that calls for low-heat laser cutting, etching, and marking. Precision laser machining is enabled by products identical to the laser proposed here: ultrafast pulse durations (precision, athermal material modification) at high-repetition rates (GHz) with tunable burst formats (advanced thermal mitigation). In addition to the commercial potential within the industrial sector, the source developed here will likely receive research funding and commercial sales from academic and government laboratories. SE\u2019s well-established partnerships with government laboratories will be strengthened with this new diagnostic research tool, particularly relative to hypersonic imaging and measurements of rotating detonation engines."

        "Abstract": "Wildfires are a 47 billion dollars per year problem: They threaten lives while damaging health, property, landscapes, and the environment. Globally these fires are releasing substantial pollution and up to 20% of Greenhouse Gas emissions into the atmosphere. Electrical power lines are a well- documented direct cause of a relevant fraction of the most devastating wildfires in recent history resulting in significant damages being assessed against our customers, the power utilities, often to the brink of bankruptcy. The proposed wildfire monitoring system prevents the damage caused from these electric grid related wildfires by providing utility customers with a push notification alert, a picture, and situational awareness data all triggered by our Artificial Intelligence-based detection system. This approach ensures that stakeholders get, in seconds, the data that they need to confirm the issue is not a false positive. Unlike other systems, we work along transmission lines, sensing fire initiation below the forest canopy. We can detect and report fires in their earliest stages, before the forest is up in smoke, while storing images and sensor data for root cause verification. During Phase I, a functioning demonstrator was built and tested near power lines. A prototype software solution was also implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of several future improvements. We created a solution that can selectively relay the data from our device directly to a visualization portal, making it accessible from any web enabled device. During Phase II, the prototype system will be iteratively improved and tested to create a viable minimum commercial offering. Similarly, the software on both the field devices and on the server will be upgraded to create a sophisticated technology platform that is user friendly. Both the hardware and software features will need to comply with the regulatory framework that manages the deployment of devices on grid assets. The anticipated yearly benefits of deploying our system across 10,000 miles of conductor are: (1) peoples\u2019 and animals\u2019 lives saved, (2) 1.5 billion dollars from reduced direct damages and firefighting costs, and (3) 138 million dollars in reduced high impact environmental damage from prevented Greenhouse Gas emissions estimated at 1 million metric tons, or the equivalent impact of taking around 200,000 cars off the road. Additional applications will provide early warning for fire vulnerable communities, better target aerial firefighting response to picture validated fires, reduce the duration of economy-damaging Public Safety Power Shutoff events, and inform the insurance market with granular risk data to retain home insurance policies."

        "Abstract": "Digitization of plant performance and O&amp;M data has become a new best practice in the world of renewable energy asset management. Large owners and operators of photovoltaic and wind power plants are working to digitize performance and O&amp;M data at their existing assets to improve their management of the facilities to increase performance, reduce O&amp;M costs, and lower the overall life cycle cost of ownership. CSP power plants are behind the curve of other technologies on the digitization of plant information to aid in the plant asset management. This project directly addresses the objective of digitizing the O&amp;M data of the solar field.\nThe parabolic trough solar fields in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants cover large areas that can be hundreds or even thousands of acres in size. Solar fields often include thousands of individually tracking parabolic trough collectors that must be maintained. Each collector contains hundreds of components that need to be individually monitored, periodically inspected, and maintained. Currently there are no commercial products available for plants to use to monitor and track the status of their solar fields. Most plants must develop their own systems and typically use a mix of paper lists and spreadsheets to monitor the status of the collectors and the maintenance work conducted in their solar fields. Most CSP plants use computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) or enterprise asset management (EAM) software packages which are adequate to maintain their power plant equipment (turbines, pumps, compressors, etc). But these systems are not well adapted for use with solar fields with 10s or 100s of thousands of components which must be monitored over large areas.\nSolar Dynamics (SD) is developing custom database-driven software and aerial drone-based inspection capabilities for monitoring and tracking the status of parabolic trough collectors in solar fields. The system can be used to monitor the solar field during construction, through operation, and final decommissioning at the end of the plant\u2019s life.\nPhase I of this effort focused on developing improved drone-based inspection techniques. SD developed techniques for assessment of receiver tube condition, mirror condition, and optical quality of collectors. Artificial intelligence (AI) was incorporated to extend the baseline aerial surveying technology to automate accurate technical assessment and rapid cataloging of problems without interrupting normal plant operations.\nOver the process of developing and demonstrating the drone data collection capabilities at modest sized plants (50 MW), massive amounts of data was collected, and it became clear that it was also necessary to develop innovative approaches for managing and viewing the data in useful ways. Such systems are needed such that plant engineers and management can query the data to analyze and identify systematic issues, enabling them to make educated and actionable management decisions. For this reason, in Phase II SD proposes to continue development of the drone-based inspections, but also to integrate the new FieldStatusTM program developed under a DOE Solar Energy Technology Office (SETO) SIPS project titled \u201cOPTOM\u201d (Optimization of Parabolic Trough Operations &amp; Maintenance, DE-EE0006379) for viewing collector status and tracking issues.\nThe SD team is well suited to execute this proposed work. SD personnel have led development, design, and operations of some of the largest CSP power plants in the world. In addition, SD has built and deployed a baseline aerial survey system that is the basis for further research and development under this SBIR project. The SD team has experience developing tools to support the O&amp;M of CSP plants."

        "Abstract": "Quantitative digital microscopy involves identifying features within captured images and counting, categorizing, and measuring each feature to extract higher order metrics to make informed decisions in a variety of fields, such as materials, biology, metrology, medicine, and additive or advanced manufacturing. The quantitative digital microscopy workflow has been a low throughput affair with a high degree of skilled human labor that is difficult to scale in the current state to meet the demands of next generation microscopy and materials characterization systems. This is exacerbated by difficult to use legacy and often \u201cquirky\u201d data analysis software that cannot process multiple data streams in parallel or automatically adapt to variations in workflow and analysis requirements. The feasibility of an automated quantitative microscopy image analysis platform that leverages the latest techniques in artificial intelligence and machine learning and overcomes the issues of scale and adaptability has been demonstrated. The proposed effort then seeks to refine this technology for full-scale commercialization. The technology, which uses a collection of independent graphical processing unit-equipped edge computing devices running state-of-the-art artificial intelligence\/machine learning models for simultaneous automated image analysis, was demonstrated at a national user facility with a multi-detector electron microscope for materials characterization. This technology will be further advanced to deploy on most microscopy instruments in a user facility while still maintaining an easy-to-use software interface and seamless integration with modern microscopy workflows. The proposed effort will then extend past the single experiment and use case demonstrated in the initial feasibility study by leveraging the zero-configuration and platform agnostic nature of the technology. Specifically, the technology\u2019s edge computing device and user interface stacks will be advanced through concentrated efforts on optimizing network communication, analysis pipelines, and visualizations for near-infinite device growth and extensibility to enable widespread adoption in industry, energy, and medical sectors using optical, charged particle, and scanning probe microscopes. The resulting outcome will be a scalable, future-proof product that ultimately converts a low throughput, manual data analysis process into a high throughput, automated platform that accelerates the innovation lifecycle of new technologies that rely on quantitative microscopy with multiple data streams, such as products and processes under development in materials science, biology, medical imaging, geology, energy storage, and energy consumption."

        "Abstract": "Digital transformation of enterprises and emergence of cloud-delivered applications and services have created virtualized, dynamic, and distributed IT infrastructures. Assuring availability, security, and performance in such an environment poses a real challenge to IT departments. Traditional IT Ops has given way to DevOps to speed up IT\u2019s service response to rapidly changing demands from their stakeholders. The rate of configuration changes in a DevOps environment is an order of magnitude greater than in a traditional IT Ops environment. Now, IT organizations are trying to leverage machine learning and advanced analytics to further automate and improve responsiveness of infrastructure services. This new trend is referred to as Artificial Intelligence for IT Ops (AIOps). DevOps environment which uses automated provisioning and software- defined orchestration cannot ignore the impact of frequent configuration changes\/updates (manifested in system\/server logs) on application infrastructure performance. Information provided by non-traditional, textual data sources, e.g., syslogs, API logs, outage reports, etc. that manifest as issues on infrastructures, become critical in infrastructure performance analytics. Today\u2019s performance-management tools primarily use numerical network-traffic-related data and limited textual data such as syslogs in silos. Mining pertinent information from textual log\/event data and correlating them with numerical performance data on the same analytics platform will lead to faster troubleshooting of application\/service infrastructure performance issues. Considering these realities, in this Phase II SBIR project, Ennetix will develop a novel, log-driven infrastructure analytics and management service, called LIAM, to enhance availability, security, and performance of modern IT infrastructures, and greatly accelerate root-cause analysis of issues. LIAM will mine non- traditional textual data, such as system\/server logs, configuration change logs, outage reports, and event re- ports from other IT management platforms; and correlate them with numerical network trace and server\/host performance data. LIAM will feature advanced machine-learning techniques based on topic mining, novelty detection, and clustering; and it will be built on a scalable architecture to accommodate other user-defined categorical data sources. LIAM will bring useful additional context to analyzing performance anomalies to reduce application\/service interruptions and accelerate root-cause identification and service restoration. During Phase I of this SBIR project, requirements analysis and design of the LIAM platform were conducted, a working prototype was developed, and evaluation studies have been performed to determine LIAM\u2019s effectiveness to support IT operations by faster root-cause analytics and troubleshooting of modern IT infrastructures. These feasibility and performance evaluation studies have been accomplished using live data gathered from a large campus IT infrastructure (namely, UC Davis). Outcomes of the Phase I R&amp;D efforts and evaluation studies have confirmed the viability of LIAM as a commercial-grade solution. In this Phase II project (as a continuation of Phase I), the goal is to significantly expand LIAM with analytical features, AI\/ML models, third-party integrations, automation methods, and innovative visualizations. A commercial-grade LIAM solution will be developed using which IT operations team can proactively manage the performance of distributed infrastructures. Early trials will be accomplished to demonstrate the functionalities and performance of LIAM on live networks and pave the way to successful market entry and deployment on premier R&amp;E organizations such as UC Davis. The proposed solution will greatly benefit IT administrators and managers at DOE and other organizations through a new approach for IT management which considers various data sources (both textual and numerical) along with traffic data and significantly reduces operational expenditures. The wider benefits of this effort will extend well beyond the immediate DOE scientific community, and on to other enterprises, network operators, and cloud-service providers, who will be able to leverage the proposed LIAM solution to proactively manage their cloud-based, distributed, and dynamic application-delivery infrastructures."

        "Abstract": "Microscopy workflows can include a detailed image analysis and quantification effort that has proven to be time consuming, cost ineffective, and potentially biased. Recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence methods have signaled a revolution in these efforts leading to accelerated and consistent quantification of digitally generated microscopy images. Given this, these innovative methods typically require cloud computing resources and at least some knowledge of software development and computing programming. This is further exacerbated by the seemingly daily release of new machine learning methods. An open software-hardware platform that overcomes these issues and embraces the rapidly evolving field has surpassed the feasibility stage and will be developed for full-scale commercialization. The technology, which uses a web-based interface hosted on a graphical processing unit-equipped edge computing device, was successfully demonstrated to host and run a state-of-the-art machine learning model to enable the first augmented reality in-situ transmission electron microscopy experiments for irradiated materials development and qualification. This technology will be further advanced to host a range of additional machine learning techniques while providing a flexible platform for integrating future techniques and methods for any automated, real-time image analysis and quantification effort. It has already been demonstrated that the interactive, real-time platform at the heart of the technology can augment the features of advanced electron microscopes resulting in reduced person hours (and in turn costs) within microscopy workflows. The proposed efforts will then extend past the niche application demonstrated in the initial feasibility study by leveraging the agnostic nature of the communication protocols used for interfacing with microscopes. Specifically, the platform\u2019s edge computing device and user interface software stacks will be advanced through concentrated efforts on expanding the hosting, deployment, and dissemination of current and future machine learning methods to enable widespread adoption in industry, energy, and medical sectors using optical, charged particle, and scanning probe microscopes. The resulting outcome will be a flexible platform that reduces labor costs by up to 80%, decouples expertise in routine microscopy tasks, and accelerates the innovation lifecycle of new technologies that rely on quantitative microscopy, such as technologies and products under development in material science, biology, medical imaging, geology, energy storage, and energy consumption."

The project seeks to enable computer learn without rehearsal, allowing corrections for details that are present in the real world environment. The aim of this project is a solution to be used by computer vision customers to solve their problems immediately (without sending data back to retrain the whole network), reducing machine and customer downtime and disruption while increasingproductivity. The initial focus is on robotics with computer vision limitations though the technology may be useful to other industries. Success in improving computer vision-based learning could facilitate disaster responses, augment current physical abilities, and enable exploration beyond the boundaries of Earth.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will help create a framework to overcome rehearsal requirements that limit automated robots\u2019 utility within life-like, dynamic environments. Artificial intelligence (AI) remains inflexible compared to humans at quickly accumulating knowledge without forgetting what they have previously learned. Robots using AI are currently only used in environments that are very limited and are very tightly controlled. Everything that might happen in the robot\u2019s work environment must be included their training set. The proposed AI solution is suited for learning in dynamic environments without rehearsal while maintaining scalability as information is encountered. This technology may allow robots to be trained within their environment. This project may enable visual capabilities leading to a demonstration of flexible learning without rehearsal within dynamic robotic environments.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the low-cost assessment of the health of structures or buildings.Often property-owners and infrastructure managers do not have a true and fair view of the actual state of their building assets. Building health is assessed from infrequent inspections or monitoring that is often uneconomical for smaller structures. This project seeks to develop a technology that is able to discern structural anomalies to facilitate risk assessment and proper management. This technology seeks todisrupt the growing market of structural health monitoring, providing an affordable solution for the assessment of the current state of buildings and structures with benefit to cost ratios over 10, installation costs ranging between $10 to $1,000 per control point and Software as a Service (SaaS) costs ranging between $10 and $500 per month. Once on the market, the technology may help to avoid dramatic human, environmental, and economic losses caused by damaged or collapsed buildings and structures.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a proof of concept solution featuring Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide insights into the conditions of buildings remotely and automatically by analyzing natural structural vibrations. The solution targets structureal assets that currently are rarely assessed but entail risk of failure. The technology takes advantages of the fact that each structure has its own natural vibration signature, which depends on its design and materials, purpose, and environment. Hidden signals of anomalies, which can be associated with degradation, flaws, or failures, can be found encoded within this vibration signature. This novel technology uses AI to provide insight into these signals and translate them into valuable information about the health of structures. The project seeks to validate the degree to which anomalous data clusters obtained from buildings or structures can be associated with damage or defects and may help to establish the precision and accuracy in anomaly detection. The project comprises the monitoring of real buildings or structures and the manufacturing of the necessary IoT devices, the structural analyses through numerical modelling, laboratory experiments with physical models, and the use of AI to control hazard risk.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based method to screen diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness in the US. DR affects almost 4 million people in the US and is associated with direct annual costs of almost $500 M. If diagnosed early, clinical treatment and lifestyle changes can halt the progression of the disease, preventing blindness. However, retinal exams currently require expensive equipment and invasive eye dilation that restrict screenings to ophthalmology or optometry practices, leading to the under-diagnosis of the condition, particularly in underserved populations. This project advances a system with a new camera and a machine learning approach to enable recognition of DR and other retinal disorders by clinicians.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to explore the feasibility of developing a novel software-enabled non-mydriatic fundus camera that can identifiy DR. The proposed innovation is based on: 1) a portable camera that uses near-infrared (NIR) light, invisible to the human eye, to illuminate the retina and acquire fundus images, enabling the use of the device by non-specialists; 2) a novel framework based on transfer learning, which trains Neural Networks with a limited amount of training data (100 images). In this project, a prototype system will collect NIR retinal images, with the goal of developing an AI classification algorithm capable of processing these images. In parallel, a new image processing algorithm will be developed to improve the resolution of the NIR images, based on contrast normalization methods and noise reduction techniques.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the development of a novel artificial intelligence technology that enables U.S. corn farmers to optimize nitrogen fertilizer applications based on field characteristics, rainfall and growing conditions. More efficient use of nitrogen fertilizer will reduce the carbon footprint of U.S. agriculture because more than 10% of the energy consumed in the U.S. agricultural sector goes toward the production of nitrogen fertilizer for corn. Because nitrogen fertilizer is a critical driver of both input costs and yield, this technology will improve the profitability of U.S. farmers by reducing input costs and maximizing corn yields. This project may enable corn production that creates less nitrogen fertilizer pollution, which threatens human health, degrades aquatic ecosystems and emits greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. A key social element of this project is a teaching module for middle-school science students that will blend content on soil science, agronomy, and crop management with the challenges faced by U.S. corn farmers to follow best management practices.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the technical feasibility of using machine learning to evaluate the amount of yellowness on the lowest corn leaves visible in images taken from low-cost cameras mounted on ground robots. Characteristic yellowness on corn leaves is a strong indicator of stress caused by insufficient nitrogen, a key nutrient. A prototype neural network model will be iteratively improved, in part by dramatically increasing the available training imagery over the course of this Phase I project. Imagery will be collected on field trials set up across several Mid-Western states. Preliminary data suggest that the extent of characteristic yellowness is an indicator of accumulated nitrogen stress that is observable only under the canopy and not via airborne sensors. A commercially available nitrogen model will be used to estimate accumulated nitrogen stress across small plots created by manipulating the amount of added nitrogen fertilizer when corn is about 1-2 feet high. Tuning will occur by adjusting key model parameters through simulation until the differences are minimized between observed and modeled accumulated nitrogen stress across a field\u2019s small plots. Parallel software development will improve prototype codes running simulations of a leading nitrogen model, enabling rapid model tuning.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 1 project is the facilitation of more widespread and affordable wildlife research, management, and monitoring through the use of internet-connected devices. Internet-mediated human control of laser hazing devices may provide cost-effective damage reduction in agricultural settings. The research is founded on the ability of lasers to repel a wide variety of birds. Human oversight will benefit from remote operation, allowing the research and development activtities to be conducted at a fraction of the cost of an on-site presence. The immediate problem addressed is avian damage. agricultural losses, predation on sensitive species, and aviation hazards.Refining and expanding the proposed model may broaden the range of solvable conservation problems. The proposed system seeks to allow one person to simultaneously operate multiple internet connected devices. The creation of reliable, remote management tools may broaden the scope and improve the efficiency of natural resource management. By allowing remote wildland views and providing opportunities for positive intervention, the technology may increase public engagement with the natural world through formal and informal education, improve the understanding of resource protection issues, and enhance public commitment to solving environmental challenges.The development of a fully integrated, remotely-operable network of internet-connected, artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced laser devices for repelling pest birds from valuable agricultural assets is proposed. The primary project goal of the project is to make non-lethal pest bird management more effective, easy, and affordable in agricultural, conservation, and commercial settings that are often remote. Phase 1 research and development will cover the creation and initial field testing of a laser array that is remotely controlled by internet connected operators. Phase 1 performance metrics will focus on reliability and ease of use as there are significant operational challenges in various settings (e.g., lack of wi-fi connectivity in wilderness and remote locations, laser safety, etc.).The project seeks to establish a template for the reliable, remote operation of a wide array of human-controlled devices via internet connections supplemented, where appropriate, with artificial intelligence. This technology may facilitate the wide adoption of more efficient approaches to wildland research, monitoring, and management as the physical presence of the operator will not be required.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to help chemists find drug candidates that can stick persistently to the correct target and work better in patients. By coming off the target prematurely, a drug stops working and may be cleared rapidly from the body. Current state-of-the-art technologies find weak binders and are plagued by other limitations. The system proposed herein tests large numbers of compounds at high throughput during drug discovery and lead optimization, replacing current systems with low throughput. The identified effective drugs must be selective to the intended target. Furthermore, the proposed system will inform Artificial Intelligence and Molecular Dynamics simulations for optimized algorithms predicting drug performance.The proposed project will solve an unmet analytical need in drug discovery and lead optimization by providing kinetic results at high throughput to refine drug designs. The proposed novel instrument and assay chemistry system measures how long chemical compounds stay on target. The solution will be benchmarked using FDA-approved drugs that use an allosteric mechanism of action to engage protein kinases AKT1 and AKT2.Inhibitors will be profiled for biochemical binding kinetics, thermodynamic analysis, and kinase selectivity in kinetic assays using novel reagents and commercial instrumentation.Dissociation rates for the allosteric drugs will be compared with literature reports. Analysis at several temperatures will measure the activation energy for the kinase to release the allosteric drug. The results will be a benchmark profile of kinetics and thermodynamics for kinase-inhibitor interactions of successful approved drugs. An advanced instrument will be built and tested in endpoint mode for sample handling, signal linearity, background and dynamic range using control reagents.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Healthcare, a $2.9 B market segment, is targeted because the need is great and the US healthcare market is highly fragmented. Making healthcare data faster to interoperate and share while maintaining data integrity, security and privacy is key to potentially improving healthcare outcomes.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is advancing foundational technology for searching and retrieving heterogeneous data secured in blockchain across a distributed data platform. Multiple data sources with different formats and data models will be transformed into more granular data blocks in blockchain. In addition to normalizing blockchain data into more granular data blocks for sharing and re-use in different applications (i.e., simplifying data integration and interoperability), research will use natural language processing (NLP) to assist in automatically generating metadata tags to facilitate searching across blockchains. To improve the accuracy of data returned in the search, a human expert-curated healthcare dictionary and thesaurus will be created and used in concert with NLP assistance. This combined approach should improve the accuracy of data retrieval by non-IT, healthcare, users across a secure, peer-to-peer data platform where data owners retain full ownership and control of their data. The proposed research will also validate through performance testing new blockchain search capabilies will meet the responsiveness and scale required by healthcare enterprises, a key need for commercialization.

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to enable widespread adoption of ultrasound imaging for musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries. The ultrasound image analysis platform enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) developed during this SBIR may bring cost-effective diagnostic imaging to a broader patient population as the small form factor of the ultrasound instrument enables the technology to be used in a variety of settings, including doctors\u2019 offices, physical therapy offices, and sports facilities. There are approximately 840,000 clinicians who see patients with MSK injuries. Each of these clinicians represents candidate customers for the platform, leading to a total addressable market in the U.S. of $1.7 billion.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to advance artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ultrasound imaging technology. Sonography is the most operator-dependent medical imaging modality in use today, limiting the use of ultrasound imaging in musculoskeletal (MSK) evaluation. The proposed approach seeks to enable the wider adoption of ultrasound for diagnosing MSK injuries. This project involves the development of rigorous mathematical models to determine whether a frame sequence is properly aligned and determine if tendon tears in shoulder scans are diagnosable. A guidance system will be developed to aid in ultrasound probe placement so that consistent identification of tendon tear presence or absence is achieved. The proposed AI-enabled approach to ultrasound imaging and diagnostics may help practitioners position the ultrasound probe without the need to maintain precise angular positioning. Once at the correct starting position, the practitioner will move the probe in a pre-prescribed motion using a guidance system as needed for accurate and efficient image capture. The goal of the technology is to enable novice practitioners to capture relevant analyses to assist in providing a diagnosis and a treatment plan.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a damage detection analysis software platform to reduce the risk of failure for heavy civil infrastructure assets (e.g., bridges and dams) while optimizing the capital allocation for these vital systems using a unique combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and civil engineering. The public utilities responsible for civil infrastructureupkeep and assessment need fast, reliable solutions to collect massive amounts of data and rapidly assess the status of large amounts of heavy civil infrastructure.They also need to be able to make accurate and timely reports to stakeholders on the structural integrity of these assets. This project aims to facilitate data-driven decision making for civic leaders regarding infrastructure investments.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and commercialize technologies to increase the automation of the infrastructure asset management process and reduce the costs of this process for asset owners. This increase in automation may also lead to improved conditions and temporal change assessment through AI-powered analytics. The resulting analytics would improve inspection practices by increasing accuracy and objectivity, leading to safer infrastructure systems and fewer infrastructure failures.The technical innovation of this Phase I project is a 3D computer vision pipeline designed to process remotely sensed data and automatically transform it into a format that meets the reporting needs of engineers. The technology addresses long-standing challenges associated with using 3D remote sensing data for infrastructure asset management by developing the foundational technical capabilities to automatically segment and transform 3D point clouds into high-resolution 2D orthomosaics of infrastructure components. Existing approaches are not flexible or generalizable, either employing highly constrained geometric approaches or statistical deep learning models, for which relevant infrastructure data sets do not exist. The proposed approach will utilize computational geometric analysis to isolate and segment point clouds into individual structural components. The process will be prototyped and revised through user pilot studies and ongoing customer discovery and validation activities.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project proposes an artificial intelligence (AI)-based platform that overcomes current shortcomings with manual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assessment, currently conducted on high-quality machines with results read by expert radiologists at a few locations around the country. AI enables MRI analysis that is automated, standardized, and more accurate.This will reduce unnecessary and invasive biopsy and\/or treatment for low-risk prostate cancers, as well as physician time and effort to run and read MRIs. Furthermore, it will enable non-expert centers to accurately diagnose patients without requiring extensive testing, top-tier MRI equipment, or invasive surgery.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project develops a novel prostate cancer diagnostic platform that leverages the power of AI-based image analysis for high sensitivity and specificity.While prostate cancer diagnostics rely heavily on MRIs, the accuracy of these assessments depends on both expert experience and MRI quality. The machine learning solution is able to make global assessments on the likelihood of detected lesions being clinically significant (i.e., Gleason 3+4\/grade group 2 or higher), better informing clinicians on appropriate treatment.This project proposes the following technology development objectives: 1) Develop a method to measure MRI quality, 2) Create a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Framework to repair images from poor to higher quality, and 3) Prospectively evaluate new framework to measure the overall performance of the AI algorithm.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The reduction in energy use afforded by the technology could save up to 2% of the total electricity consumption nationwide, making it one of the most environmentally friendly computing platforms. Furthermore, the superconductor-based hardware has the potential to provide one of the fastest commercialized high-performance computing platforms for both industry and research, offering the potential to solve current computational problems in many fields. The development of high-frequency neuromorphic computing, with specific application to artificial intelligence applications, promises to strengthen the US economy.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to bring to the technological forefront a high-speed superconductor electronics-based neuromorphic computer centered around neural units with adjustable weights serving as a disordered array. Currently, high-speed computing necessary for large artificial intelligence models is bottlenecked at semiconductor device architecture as Moore\u2019s Law reaches its limits. Much of the necessary computing power is only accessible via paid run time on vast server banks owned by a select few companies that can afford to build them. By unlocking computing power based on SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) arrays and rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ), the project aims to develop an affordable, reliable, and carbon friendly high-speed computing platform, thereby helping to solve the power\/cost crisis facing currently accessible computing systems.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the edge computing capabilities infiltrate into industrial IoT application domains to overcome the limitation of centralized computing (latency, bandwidth, and single point of failure), constrained hardware (compute and storage) resources, and data availability. The proposed technology may adjust with the changing cyber-physical environment, extend situational awareness, protect against cyber security threats, minimize the cost of scaling network and cloud infrastructures, and deliver extreme responsiveness within mission critical ecosystems such as smart grid surveillance, remote patient monitoring, autonomous vehicles, and defense weaponry systems.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will research a cognitive internet-of-things (IoT) runtime that enhances process automation and analytical capabilities of edge native M2M\/IoT solutions. The recent trends of edge computing have created service opportunities catering to real-time use cases closer to the operating environment. The most common predefined rule-based logic and structured intelligence on edge nodes fails to deliver scalability, autonomy, interoperability, and intelligent control operations. The artificial intelligence (AI) \/ Machine Learning (ML) models usually perform better on cloud or multiclause server infrastructure in a batch mode. This invention closes the existing gap and further advances the distributed edge computing capabilities by introducing Cognitive AI models that introduce semantic learning with incremental data from within embedded runtime and develop reasoning through interactions within the connected environment. The research and development on Per-to-Peer collaboration across the edge nodes overcomes the limitations of constrained resource and executes workflows. The runtime architecture simulates the human nervous system\u2019s anatomical layers and systematic coordination of neuro-motor operations.The proposed design patterns of analytical models and distributed intelligence will introduce a realistic implementation of smarter decision support systems on the edge that could adapt to ever changing operational contexts and introduce diverse intelligent operations through collaborative learning.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed method is wholly unsupervised, requiring no known examples of poisoned DNNs nor any samples from the (possibly poisoned) training set. This project will advance a broadly applicable and computationally efficient approach through parallel computation leveraging cost-effective cloud-computing services, to address challenges such as very large input feature space dimensions and number of classes, as well as very large DNNs. Another challenge is to make the detector insensitive to the mechanism (e.g., additive, multiplicative) by which the backdoor pattern (BP) is incorporated into a sample across different application domains. In addition to &quot;static&quot; DNNs and image domains, the prototype will be able to: process recurrent DNNs; handle time series, point cloud, and document data domains; and defend AIs used for time-series prediction and regression. APIs will be developed to expand the prototype to defend against related attacks, e.g., backdoor patterns that are perceptible but &quot;scene plausible&quot; or test-time evasion attacks.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Access to clean, reliable water supplies is critical to our quality of life and our economy, yet across the country millions of Americans do not have access to groundwater that meets drinking water standards. The contaminants that plague drinking water range from common water toxins, such as arsenic and cadmium, to excess nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), which are particularly problematic in agriculture regions. Over the next thirty years, the world&apos;s population is expected to reach at least 10 billion people, which will create an increase in demand for food and other products that cannot be met with traditional agricultural approaches. In fact, agricultural resources are almost already completely exploited, with very little arable land left to farm, and climate change and population sprawl pose impending threats that will need to be met with rapid innovation. Ultimately, drastic changes in agrotechnology are needed to sustainably source critical food supplies and other essential products. Recent advances in sensing and machine learning technologies are opening up the possibility for &quot;smart sensor&quot; approaches to automation and optimization of agricultural resources that could have a significant impact on our ability to meet the demands of a growing population while addressing the need for sustainable farming. While the emergence of these technologies is exciting, innovative projects are needed to integrate state-of-the-art approaches into simple, user-friendly systems that lend themselves to rapid and widespread adoption. Our proposal aims to meet this challenge by combining a state-of-the-art real-time nutrient sensor with an artificial intelligence platform that will incorporate multiple streams of data to provide a &quot;drop in&quot; technology that can integrate with almost any type of low-input water reuse technology to enable simple, affordable, and sustainable water reclamation for a broad range of agricultural applications."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this SBIR Phase I project is to create an artificial intelligence-powered printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) service that facilitates innovation and economic growth in the United States. Prototyping PCBAs is a key element in the innovation process for all electronics from consumer goods to medical devices, but current PCBA prototyping services are limited by manual steps and supply chain shortages. The artificial intelligence innovation of this project will save the customers time through strategic automation, shortening innovation timelines, and bringing new products to market faster. Currently, China and other Asian countries are still dominating the PCBA market share, serving many customers from the United States. There is an opportunity to provide high-quality, cost-competitive manufacturing in the United States to better serve the market and meet the rising demand for PCBAs. Additionally, investment in domestic manufacturing will strengthen electronic manufacturing capabilities, reduce dependence on foreign markets, and protect intellectual property.The technical innovation of this project is the development of two artificial intelligence algorithms that work together to determine the optimal selection of components to be mounted on a customer\u2019s printed circuit board. The first algorithm reads the design file and identifies the properties of the components that the user has specified for their design. The second algorithm takes these properties as its input and selects in stock parts for the components in the design which will then be mounted onto the printed circuit board. This is a cost and time saving innovation that uses state of the art artificial intelligence algorithms and encodes electrical engineering principles. The key objectives for this project are to understand the types and combinations of components that our customers are likely to use in their designs, to define and test the algorithm for component property identification, and to define and test the algorithm which will choose the optimal components used for the manufacture of PCBAs.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to secure Integrated Circuit (IC) Intellectual Property (IP) against untrusted parties in the globalized IC supply chain.Outsourcing of IC foundries creates risks of IC reverse engineering, overproduction, theft, and even piracy. A promising method of achieving hardware IP security is by logically locking the functionality of a design by replacing a subset of the design components with programmable elements. The correct content of these elements forms the key for unlocking\/activation of the design in a secure facility and\/or via a secure protocol after manufacturing. A technical challenge in commercializing this technology is the long time period typically needed to assess the security of a locked design against state-of-the-art attack algorithms at the design phase. This project will address this technical challenge by developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted design security analyzer tool to instantaneously provide an accurate attack runtime estimation on a locked design, significantly reducing the design time.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will significantly shorten the time required to assess attack resiliency of an obfuscated (locked) Integrated Circuit (IC) design. Running the state-of-the-art Boolean Satisfiability solvers (SAT attack) on a state-of-the-art computer server to de-obfuscate a locked design can take time - ranging from days to months. Such a long security analysis time is prohibitive for deployment in the design process where iterative design optimizations are needed for making power, performance, area, and security (PPAS) trade-offs. This project aims to address this challenge by introducing a novel approach that will bring the security assessment time down to near zero using a machine-learning based model. Based on recent advancements in graph and geometric deep learning techniques, an innovative end-to-end security assessment framework is proposed that directly and losslessly ingests the original design as a graph-structured input, and then automatically learns the discriminative features that influence logic locking security. To support sufficient data for the proposed data-driven method, a logic locking macro-database will be developed that encompasses the required PPAS, attack and defense information.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in helping in the design of a cost-effective resiliency strategy for defense against the impacts of climate change. Today, the U.S. experiences significantly more weather events imposing substantially more financial burden compared to 40 years ago. As climate change accelerates, communities will be forced to endure increased financial burdens protecting against and mitigating its impacts. Research carried out in this SBIR project is intended to help reduce these expenses. Utilities, cities, insurance companies, and municipalities are stakeholders in these resiliency efforts and will be looking for new tools to help mitigate the effects and reduce the costs of climate change. The research in this project will enable utilities to reduce resilience-related costs and reduce impact on businesses and local economies due to power outages.Such actions may benefit all communities, particularly poorer and marginal communities that often endure the worst impacts of climate change.This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop predictive analytics for tropical storms and wildfires and to integrate this functionality into a power grid analytics software platform.Three artificial intelligence\/machine learning (AI\/ML) tools will be implemented, qualitatively expanding on early prototypes: (1) in the satellite imagery (SI) domain, an optimized combination of deep-learning neural network (DLNN) techniques will be trained on large-scale satellite images, resulting in the world&apos;s first tree growth tracking and species identification tool; (2) a &quot;Virtual Wind Tunnel&quot; (VWT) will be augmented with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and empirical physics modeling to estimate the probability of trees damaging power transmission assets during weather events forecast; and (3) towards a no-code user interface, existing natural language processing (NLP) will be expanded, with the goal of processing queries from engineers unfamiliar with AI\/ML. Key questions addressed by the research include whether the software platform will be able to adapt to new utility customers and service areas without sacrificing performance, whether increased data resolution can be effectively leveraged to better predictive power, and whether the platform can continuously improve event prediction over time by learning from historical grid data.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computer Numerical Control (CNC), the computer-automated management of machining tools\u2019 operations, is a key process in precision manufacturing. Programming CNC machines requires professionals with vast and specialized technical skills. With fewer graduates of trade schools, CNC programming know-how has become a bottleneck to manufacturing operations, creating an urgent unmet need for a radically simplified and automated CNC programming workflow to improve accessibility to precision manufacturing. This project aims to develop an artificial intelligence tool to automate the CNC programming process, thereby helping ease the CNC programming bottleneck and fill the skills gap at reduced manufacturing time and costs.This project will expand research on the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for generative CNC programming in precision manufacturing. AI has the potential to automate various steps in the CNC programming workflow; however, this research has been limited to constrained machining conditions and has not focused on optimization procedures, thereby limiting its real-world applicability. This project expands this research to develop a commercially viable solution for the optimal cutting tool and machining parameter selection stage of CNC programming. Briefly, this project will address technical challenges of algorithm development and optimization to improve accurate selection of tool and machining parameters. The results will be validated on CNC machines. At the end of Phase I, a proof-of-concept solution will be developed to automate the optimal cutting tool and machining parameters selection for CNC drilling and milling.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to extract new valuable information from medical images, accelerate image interpretation by radiologists, and improve patient outcomes. The process of identifying key features in images, known as ``labeling&apos;&apos;, is the key to improved diagnosis and management of certain conditions.The innovations proposed here will substantially lower the cost of labeled datasets, enabling access for developers of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and improving the use of AI in health care.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will apply machine learning algorithms to develop a system for assisting in manual labeling of medical tomographic images. The proposed research will result in an adaptive system architecture that evolves to accelerate labeling and increase the volume of labeled data. Moreover, the research will increase labeling accuracy at the edges of anatomical structures. For instance, surgical resections for cancer treatment requires accurate labeling of the edges of abnormal tissue to ensure clean margins and minimal recurrence. Similarly, radiation therapy planning requires accurate labeling of the edges of organs at risk for safety and favorable outcomes. Due to its clinical importance, accurate manual labeling of ambiguities and sophisticated shapes is highly time-consuming. The proposed approach is differentiated from current methods by the inclusion of an additional subsystem for increasing the accuracy of edge labeling.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology will not only improve the quality of care for patients, but also enable widespread use of safely-monitored, home-based pulmonary rehabilitation, which will contribute to a reduction in patient morbidity and mortality related to respiratory diseases. The platform will also potentially enable a large collection of respiratory physiological data, providing a valuable database for clinical and scientific research as well as a framework for the use of artificial intelligence tools that may improve respiratory care.The proposed project addresses the challenge of telemonitoring the respiratory condition of patients suffering from asthma and other pulmonary diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The current standard of care relies on intermittent monitoring via stethoscope by a trained healthcare professional, which raises significant inter-user variability in the assessment and classification of lung sounds. The proposed project will advance noise reduction, design-to-cost, and design-for-manufacturing improvements, upgrading the backend data annotation and analysis system to ensure system scalability and validating the system usability and safety with substantial and relevant patient testing. The final smart wearable stethoscope platform will enable development of predictive algorithms that offer prolonged monitoring and recording of lung acoustic signals for improved care.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to accelerate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines for conditions such as COVID-19. The ability to accurately determine if cells are infected with virus is crucial for evaluating antiviral drugs and vaccine candidates. Currently, determining if a virus is infectious is done by infecting cells and waiting for them to die, which can take many days. The proposed technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze images of cells for signs of virus. This can be done within hours of infection instead of days, which can greatly accelerate the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. In addition, it is simpler because the AI analysis is automated and does not need special probes or dyes to detect viruses.The proposed project will collect images of cells infected with various viruses imaged with automated microscopes. AIs will be trained to distinguish healthy and sick cells at various times after infection. The project will study many different viruses and the changes they induce in cells. The trained AIs will be used to process infectivity assays. The software will run on remote data centers and thus images will be uploaded for analysis and reporting. An AI can be trained using images from the common 96-well plate.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A strong need exists for a platform to measure mental disorders objectively and enable collaboration between multiple stakeholders for affordable quality mental healthcare. This project advances a talk therapy software that extracts voice biomarkers from 60-second speech samples to measure the severity of emotional distress for children and adolescents. The platform\u2019s voice-based algorithm augments therapists&apos; clinical capabilities \u2013 increasing the capacity of community mental health providers to address both quality and the issue of access.The proposed project develops a voice-based biomarker algorithm trained to understand behavioral and emotional tendencies and anticipate future behaviors to determine if a child\u2019s vocal utterances deviate from age-appropriate linguistic and speech patterns. The company is developing a proprietary clinical voice sample database and repository representing marginalized communities (African American, Latino, and Caucasian within rural communities) that will exceed in both volume and accuracy those of its industry peers. Today, the company\u2019s database consists of a diverse, foundational set and size of voice samples essential for developing a more accurate algorithm(s) to detect and predict emotional disorder severity. The proposed research within Phase II builds on the progress achieved in Phase I, using speech emotion recognition and Machine Learning (ML) to identify measurable biomarkers for trauma and stress. The methodology links trauma, stress, and voice types.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gait analysis monitors how individuals walk to predict or prevent injuries and track rehabilitation progress. Due to the potentially high equipment costs, space requirements, and required technical expertise to collect and interpret results, detailed gait analyses are limited to a few centers and mainly used for surgical decision-making.This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) for gait analysis at roughly 70% less than typical costs, as well as offering reduced set-up time and improved workflow efficiency.The proposed project will address the existing technological and commercial barriers that make gait analysis an exclusive clinical tool restricted to only 300 gait labs across the country.This project will develop a cost-effective markerless motion 3D-tracking system. Technical activities include: (1) increase the motion database to a diverse population, including children and patients with mobility impairments; (2) improve the computer vision algorithms to account for multiple individuals within the camera system\u2019s field of view; (3) integrate EMG and Force Plates; (4) implement skeletal geometry estimation from computed tomography; (5) develop a self-calibration system that can operate with HD low cost cameras; and (5) improve accuracy and usability substantially to reduce the expertise required for computational gait analysis.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "CleanRobotics seeks to improve the US recycling system by using robotic sorting, powered by object detection, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI\/ML) to sort up between 2-4 streams (recycling, compost, landfill, etc) at the point of collection. This will improve the collection and sortation of recyclables in the US, where total collection rates are 35% and successful sortation rates are less than 50% (worse than random chance). CleanRobotics developed a robotic sorting system called TrashBot. TrashBot uses cloud storage and machine learning to determine which object users have dropped into the receptacle and the objects\u2019 level of contamination.TrashBot then drops the item in the proper storage receptacle on the inside of the system. TrashBot identifies contaminated items and keeps them from entering the recycling stream. Each TrashBot unit is deployed with a screen. CleanRobotics uses these screens to provide educational content, especially as it relates to contamination. When users throw away contaminated recyclables, the system separates the contaminated item into the landfill and informs the user why the item was contaminated. In small scale trials, this method has proven effective at decreasing the amount of contaminates in the recycling stream. TrashBot collects data on every item users deposit. The system sends data to a centralized location where AI\/ML systems determine patterns and identify trends in waste generation habits of TrashBot users. Cloud connectivity allows individual TrashBot units to learn from the global TrashBot fleet. This will increase the quality of the data we collect and drive AI\/ML-based improvements to the TrashBot system over time. We analyze data collected in two ways: 1.) In the specific TrashBot deployment (i.e. the stadium, office building, airport, etc.) 2.) Across all TrashBot deployments. This data gives the CleanRobotics team and building managers insight into the kinds of items users are throwing away and trends in municipal solid waste generation. This improves AI\/ML quality and allows us to tailor the messages we display on the TrashBot screen. CleanRobotics has conducted pilots and small-scale deployments of the TrashBot system. Customers include Google, The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, AEG, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, Pittsburgh International Airport, UNC Charlotte, and several other companies. In one year, TrashBots: 1.) Sorted 30,000 items with 90% accuracy , 2.) Diverted 1,800 lbs of recyclables compared to 650 lbs with conventional bins, 3.) Saved companies from emitting five tons of C02."

E-commerce sales are increasing 20% year over year. During the COVID-19 pandemic additional retail volume shifted online and many customers became accustomed to sourcing essentials using e-commerce. This shift has put a greater burden on asupply chain infrastructure that has traditionally relied on human labor to pick, sort, pack, and process items for delivery. These manual processes are monotonous, error-prone, and sometimes dangerous, have extremely high worker turnover. The automation of these processes elevates worker roles and brings greater consistency to the processes. The innovation developed during this Phase II project may enable broader automation of complex materials handling processes by creating novel training systems for artificial intelligence-enabled robotic systems that are configured specifically for individual customer needs. This innovation may increase US supply chain resilience, enabling citizens to rapidly and reliably obtain necessities such as food, medicine, and health supplies without needing to leave their homes. The commercial opportunity is large, with over $20B spent on US pick and pack wages annually.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to develop new methods for rapidly training artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled robotic systems built for object identification and manipulation. Warehouse object manipulation tasks are variable and automating them often requires custom solutions for each customer and facility. These custom solutions are often prohibitively expensive. To solve these problems, an industrial operating system that can be deployed across many configurations of materials handling processes is required. This project aims to develop modules critical to scaling commercial deployments, such as quality control vision systems, automated assessments of item pickability, and enhanced AI systems for robotic picking. The anticipated result of this project is an industrial AI-enabled robotic operating system that allows rapid configuration of robotic systems to implement highly-optimized processes for picking and packing individual items in e-commerce logistics.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Phase I project is to develop a novel artificial-intelligence (AI) robot-control paradigm to facilitate real-time tele-robotics and advance humankind\u2019s robotic capability. This AI constantly interprets the intent of the operator in the context of the robot\u2019s environment, and makes real-time adjustments to the motion of the robot to accomplish the intended task. Ultimately, this allows the operator to focus on the objective instead of operating the robot. This project will allow tele-robotics to become a viable solution in uncertain environments where traditional control schemes, with inherent latency and precision issues, currently prevent adoption of robotic solutions. This benefits applications in which a higher degree of expertise and decision-making is required to perform tasks in a dangerous or inaccessible location. The first application of this technology will allow nurses to provide patient care within hospital isolation environments to prevent exposure to the patient and care-providers. Additional applications include military, industrial maintenance, aerospace, public safety, energy, mining, and undersea solutions. Tele-robotics is a $62B market in 2019 growing by 13.5% annually.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to address the nursing crisis with an AI-enhanced robotic in patient-isolation environments. Instead of delaying care to don and doff personal-protective equipment, nurses can instantly work through the eyes, ears, and arms of these robots. The key innovation in this Phase I project is novel AI which will intuit the intent of the operator to successfully complete tasks. The proposed research will develop a robot control policy which observes the robot\u2019s current environment as well as the users control inputs, and actuates a robot to achieve the desired task. The robot will self-correct for errors made by the user through an understanding of the desired outcomes. At the end of this Phase I project, we expect the robot to perform a demonstration of accurate and timely object manipulation while controlled by a remote operator without line of sight to the work area. In a subsequent phase, the ultimate technical objective is for the solution to be as intuitive and invaluable as a modern smartphone. The business objective, developed in partnership with healthcare systems, is to provide better isolation-patient outcomes while improving productivity and reducing health risk for nurses.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Scene simulation is an integral component of weapon system research &amp; development, allowing researchers to evaluate new sensor concepts entirely in the digital space as well as drive scene projection during hardware-in-the-loop testing. Unfortunately, research scientists are limited to a small set of available background environments that cover only a few geographic locations and environmental conditions. VSI proposes GEOSIM, a background simulation capability designed to recreate geographic locations for a range of resolution, spectral signatures, and environmental conditions by leveraging government-owned &amp; open-source data resources and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. VSI is uniquely suited to this project, offering expertise in artificial intelligence &amp; machine learning, 3D reconstruction, 3D simulation, and remote sensing; extensive experience in the development of innovative software solutions for challenging defense and intelligence problems; and a thorough understanding of the needs of digital engineering scientists across the defense and intelligence community."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to support the ability of neurosurgeons to remove brain tumors or brain tissue that is causing seizures while protecting the patient\u2019s mental function. As many as 4 in 5 neurosurgery patients self-report a cognitive difficulty after surgery that negatively impacts their quality of life. Neurosurgical interventions to remove brain tumors or treat medically refractory epilepsy try not to cause post-operative cognitive deficits in patients, but sometimes the pathological tissue that needs to be removed is involved with brain tissue that supports critical abilities, like the abilities to talk, remember, or move. Because there is inter-individual variability in the precise location of higher critical functions (e.g., language, memory, locomotion), each patient\u2019s brain must be mapped in a personalized way. Ultimately, patients want confidence they will be the same person coming out of brain surgery as they were going into surgery, and clinical teams want tools that support quantitative pre-operative surgical planning and evidence-based projections of post-operative function.This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to support the development of a software product that enables neurosurgical teams to track patients\u2019 mental function over the trajectory of their care, i.e., a type of cognitive dashboard. Current practice lacks a tool that identifies brain tissue that, if removed, would result in long-term cognitive deficits. This project\u2019s core deliverable is a turn-key software platform that supports brain mapping protocols, as well as assessment, scoring, archiving and sharing of measures of mental function across the timeline of care of each patient. The software platform will integrate with critical existing systems already in place in all medical centers (e.g., cranial navigation, electroencephlogram (EEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) stimulus display systems). Follow-on work to this project\u2019s core deliverable is based on the premise that data from prior studied patients can be used to train artificial intelligence\/machinge learning (AI\/ML) algorithms which can then be used to simulate the expected effect of a given surgical plan on a new patient\u2019s future cognitive function.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact\/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to provide a novel, predictive analytics technology for industrial enterprises that require low-latency analytics insights, i.e., companies that cannot afford the kind of delayed insights that are widely present in almost all Cloud-based analytics solutions. Large manufacturing and energy enterprises are comprised of multiple plants sites spread across different geographical locations. These plants contain critical processes and equipment that are monitored using sensors and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Predictive analytics, a key component in digital transformation, targets the analysis of large volumes of industrial data to generate insights to improve the efficiency of industrial operations, optimize processes, and reduce the life cycle costs of critical equipment and machinery. The prevailing solutions in today\u2019s market rely on using the Cloud to consolidate data, perform analytics, and extract valuable insights. This process creates significant delays for many industrial processes that require immediate insights into their critical operations. The process is also not suitable for companies that have heightened security and privacy protocols (such as nuclear plants and defense manufacturing). The company seeks to enable companies to conduct predictive analytics on geographically distributed data silos without the need to move data from its location, thus reducing decision latency.This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a technology stack that leverages the blockchain to train advanced analytic algorithms and Machine Learning models across data silos in different locations without relying on the Cloud or any corporate server.Specifically, the project targets the innovative integration of the blockchain Smart Contracts with distributed memory programming frameworks like the Message Passing Interface (MPI). This integration raises several interesting research challenges one of which requires designing basic primitives similar in functionality to a Map-Reduce framework for the blockchain. The second research component revolves around the development of novel algorithmic decomposition schemes for popular Machine Learning algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) models to facilitate their training in a decentralized manner using the blockchain. If successful, this technology may provide analytic insights faster than the Cloud. It may also significantly reduce the cost and labor associated with implementing and deploying industrial analytics. Data science teams will be provided with the agility and flexibility to modify and redeploy algorithms without having to rebuild and redesign data pipeline infrastructure to a centralized server.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It provides an integrated solution for capturing the valuable information captured by people\u2019s direct experiences (photos, stories, and data) with climate change that are otherwise underutilized.The team will develop a community knowledge platform that can process a mix of text and photo data submitted by residents and process it into formats usable for understanding on-the-ground impacts, flood occurrence and severity, and deliver that data to planners and modelers developing ways to better manage floods.Data processing occurs behind the scenes and allows residents to engage with the planning processes impacting their communities in new ways, increase the access of underrepresented communities, and improve equity in decision-making.The project will stimulate research in data sciences, generate new types of jobs in civic data systems, and improve the efficiency of public infrastructure investments.User\u2019s cell phones will become powerful local data collection tools allowing a direct line of communications and building trust between government decision makers, scientists, and residents.Advances in data science allows the analysis of heterogeneous qualitative and image data to incorporate user generated posts into large scale infrastructure planning around climate resilience.Currently, descriptive data and photos submitted by users are manually analyzed for content.Through novel use of natural language processing (NLP), spatial data analysis, artificial intelligent (AI) and computer vision of flood event photos, and development of an application programming interface (API) to curate data for hydrological model developers, this project automates the process of extracting the full value of community generated posts of flood events.When successful, hyperlocal user generated posts will be processed in real time to deliver detailed on-the-ground data on flood events to planners, for model validation, and community members themselves.The product builds innovative technologies to permit processing at scale so that any community experiencing flood events can generate real time flood data and monitor the impact of infrastructure as hydrological baselines continue to shift.The project develops new machine learning NLP to automate the analysis of qualitative text data, keyword detection for sentiment analysis and impact, AI to extract flood characteristics from photos, and API for protecting model IP while allowing integration with external data for validation purposes.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "Neutron scattering makes invaluable contributions to the physical, chemical, and nanostructured materials sciences. Single-crystal diffraction experiments collect volumetric scattering data sets representing the internal structure relations by combining many individual settings at different orientations, times, and sample environment conditions. It is important to be able to access the global picture through simultaneous and interactive visualization and analysis of the data. An online graphical user interface for neutron scattering scientists and visiting researchers will be developed to visualize and post-process multiple instances of wide-ranging data sets. This challenge will be addressed via multiple innovative techniques, including revolutionary server- side hardware acceleration to enable rapid data exploration. Machine learning techniques will be used to automatically extract salient features and crystal data, while removing instrumental noise. In collaboration with a state-of-the-art neutron science center, a working prototype has been developed and deployed. The hardware accelerator runs on a commercial cloud-hosted server; the visualization and graphical user interface are managed on a conventional computing cluster, also in the cloud; and the test user works from a laptop computer. Responsive visualization of remote 3D neutron scattering data has been demonstrated in a way that was not previously possible. A variety of machine learning algorithms were applied to data discovery and analysis, as well as noise reduction, setting the stage for future success. Configurable open-source software will be developed for the single-crystal neutron scattering community and the X-ray beamline community, providing unprecedented artificial intelligence and 3D visualization capabilities. By focusing on 3D visualization and using standard open-source visualization libraries, this new software technology will be compatible with long-range software development plans at the collaborating neutron science center and at several domestic X-ray light source user facilities. Effective management of live data streams from ongoing experiments will be a priority. Enabling the inspection and extraction of data, including automated detection of features and problems, will yield unprecedented advances in experiment management, big data analysis and scientific discovery. Improved capabilities for exploring large 3D data sets will bene?t commercial companies as well as university and lab researchers. The commercialization strategy will include contract R&amp;D and subscription-based sales of our online software. The software developed for this project will be open source, and novel aspects will be published in the scientific literature."

        "Abstract": "The broader impacts of this SBIR Phase I project include a more sustainable and profitable trucking industry, enhanced conditions for the trucking workforce, improved public road safety, reduced emissions, and a path to future advancements using alternative energy and autonomous technologies. This project centers on a patented technology that pools shipments and matches tractors and drivers with trailers and cargo in a relay fashion that ensures equipment and cargo keep moving while drivers return home daily. Research has established the theoretical viability of applying relay models in long-haul trucking to solve equipment and human capacity issues. Using relay trucking could potentially double asset utilization, cut delivery times in half, and decrease the high cost of truck driver turnover. To date, no company has created a technology to implement scalable relays in American trucking. Customer discovery and research suggests this is due to the complexity of predicting and mitigating real-world trucking disruption events (e.g. traffic accidents, equipment breakdown etc.). The project aims to assess the feasibility of developing a machine learning (ML) based predictive analytics tool to make our relay technology resilient to disruptions in the driver scheduling and truck route optimization problem. A successful project would extend a relay trucking model beyond largely theoretical studies to build the first real-world application in the U.S. It aligns with NSF\u2019s mission by transforming the trucking industry while creating better jobs for new and existing truckers and reducing carbon emissions. We estimate that resolving the inefficiencies resulting in the loss of $110 billion per year.This project aims to prove the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) techniques to build a predictive tool that integrates with our relay scheduling algorithms to effectively estimate the likelihood of occurrence of disruption events and provide actionable intelligence for deployment of mitigation strategies. A successful outcome will create resilient relay algorithms necessary to commercialize the first scalable relay trucking operations in the U.S. While the use of ML has been explored in predicting weather and traffic events in the recent past, no off-the-shelf ML tools are known to exist that can be utilized for this patented relay technology. This project leverages real-world proprietary operational data from large trucking companies, combined with public data sources and artificially populated datasets representing drivers and equipment informed by work with local partners at relay nodes.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact \/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to develop a collaborative-learning platform that generates accurate population health models from secure access to patient records.The proposed system will overcome privacy concerns to enable AI methods to securely access hundreds of millions of patient records from multiple institutions across the US to learn high-performing predictive models. Models learned from this platform are differentiated due to their training data and help payors, providers, and pharma companies that benefit from early diagnosis and treatment of patients that may have remained undiagnosed. This system will improve patient outcomes and health care system performance.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will address fundamental limitations that can deter medical institutions from sharing patient data to support learning clinical-grade models. Unlike federated learning (FL), neither local data nor local model parameters are shared; rather, local classifiers predict labels for an unlabeled global dataset. Sharing model parameters in FL can violate privacy requirements and expose patient data used for local training. This novel platform is designed to be immune to the \u201cwhite box\u201d attacks of FL, and its main privacy risk for membership inference is significantly lower. This platform will accurately include information from all subpopulations and will support collaborative learning for multiple ML algorithms, including human-interpretable algorithms that cannot be learned with FL. Accuracy will be evaluated via sensitivity and specificity, privacy via membership vulnerability. Methods compared include federated learning and differential privacy.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to improve the consistency of functional food and beverage and dietary supplements (FFBDS).Functional ingredients are ingredients that have benefits beyond normal nutrition, such as curcumin (turmeric), green tea, and cranberry extract. Currently FFBDS companies face challenges in sourcing functional ingredients that are consistent in their quality from batch-to-batch. The testing methods measure only the ingredient quantity and not quality. This project advances a technology to measure the effectiveness of these functional ingredients.This information enables FFBDS manufacturers to provide clarity, trust, and ease to the process of purchasing functional products. Furthermore, this can also be used to identify the specific health benefits and develop personalized nutrition products. In addition, the data can provide traceability and information for sustainable farming, harvesting, extracting, and manufacturing practices.The proposed project will develop biological effect benchmarks for the pure form of functional ingredients, starting with turmeric, using commercially available human cells, genomics, and artificial intelligence technologies.The project will develop a test to measures a compound&apos;s biological effectiveness compared to that of the benchmark. The system will generate a biological effect score of the ingredient, a list of key genes affected, and a description of the relevance of these genes on human health. The system will be developed for high-throughput, cost-effective operation.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The initial target market segment for this technology is the ~$1 billion law enforcement market as there is a high need for tools that can help de-escalate situations and potentially improve the use-of-force decisions. The pain points of acute stress impacting decision-making have been validated in military and professional athletic markets as well.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a wearable technology that uses skin conductivity to measure stress and alert users via vibrational feedback. This Phase 1 project proposes to: (1) run a pilot study on police officers to collect skin conductance data during scenario training, (2) build machine learning artificial intelligence (AI) models with a high predictive accuracy of poor decision making using this data, (3) determine ideal sensor location and build a custom wearable strap attachment, (4) develop the mobile application to build a data visualization interface for officers and trainers, and (5) test the effectiveness of delivering vibrational feedback during decision making of officers using the prototype. The successful conclusion of Phase 1 may lead to a hardware-software prototype that measures the police officers&apos; emotional stress using a skin conductance signal, then alerts the user via vibrational feedback when they are in a heightened level of stress.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mohs surgery is the treatment of choice for skin cancer because it results in the highest cure rates, but it often takes place in stages, extending surgical procedures. The use of ex vivo confocal microscopy (XVM) is potentially faster, less costly, and inherently both 3-D and digitized, with benefits including: 1) enhanced accuracy, precision, and margin control via enriched 3D information content and simplified specimen orientation maintenance, decreasing error and improving functional outcomes; 2) decreased duration of open surgical wounds potentially reducing the rate of complications; and (3) enhanced and accelerated surgical workflows.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to improve Mohs surgery and other margin screening applications. Using confocal image processing software, the proposed software will improve current pathology processing methods by enabling rapid processing and re-coloring of XVM images, visualization without the need for retraining, and automated detection of residual tumor at the patient\u2019s bedside, all within minutes. The research described here will result in the production of a fully functional and robust software product through the following development projects: 1) Artificial intelligence (AI)-based software for image preprocessing and colorization\/enhancement, and 2) AI-based software for automated identification of key morphological features and diagnosis of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma. The proposed technology will streamline cancer specimen processing, ultimately improving patient outcomes.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, there is no cost-effective power solution for off-grid, small-scale, energy capture applications at sea. The project deliverables may benefit the commercial ocean sector as well as the Federal government and local municipalities by enabling cheaper and more reliable power at sea. This enabling technology may contribute to the ability for planners and decision-makers to anticipate and adapt to changing marine conditions, which will ultimately reduce costs and increase reliability for taxpayers. Additionally, to achieve its commercial objectives, the participating small business is committed to sustainability in its growth plan and aims to reduce carbon emission by working with local vendors and locally-sourced, recyclable materials. The small business will also continue its existing partnerships with local technical training\/trade schools and workforce development programs to mentor underserved students and create jobs.This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to leverage advanced artificial intelligence for optimizing power output. The project seeks to demonstrate the application of advanced machine learning techniques to improve the efficiency and energy capture, and reduce the intermittency, of renewable ocean-based power generation.

        "Abstract": "The broader impact of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in enabling an energy-efficient and cost-effective solution for a healthy, sustainable built environment. Stringent environmental protection policies are presenting the building industry with challenges in reducing environmental impacts. High performing windows could play an role in reducing energy use and pollutant emissions. Creating a window system that reduces building energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions may have broad societal, economic, and commercial impacts. The proposed biochromic windows can serve as an alternative, energy efficient retrofit and help meet net zero energy, net zero carbon buildings. Their multiple environmental, economic, and social benefits include high energy efficiency, improved air quality, carbon capture, and renewable energy production. Energy efficient window retrofitting accounts for over 60% of the global window market share. In 2021, the global window market grew to $10 billion for replacement and renovation and $6 billion for new construction with a compound annual growth rate of 8.6% and 8.3% respectively. This energy efficient, carbon sink technology may result in 20~30% energy savings and carbon reductions. The good air quality further benefits occupant health and well-being, making the building more appealing to occupants, industry professionals, and stakeholders.The key technical innovation of the biochromic window is to integrate biological cells within a window assembly for commercial building retrofitting applications. As a primary building enclosure system mediating between indoor and outdoor environments, the biochromic window offers improved insulation, dynamic shading efficacy, daylight penetration, views to outside, carbon dioxide (CO2) biofixation, and biomass production, all of which are attributes of improved building energy efficiency, good indoor air quality, beneficial carbon sequestration, novel biofuel production, and user satisfaction. The primary project objectives are to: 1) prototype of a biochromic window, integrated with an intelligent control system to enable the maximum performance; 2) conduct performance testing and obtain performance certificates; and 3) scale-up mass production manufacturing and carry out technology demonstrations at early adopter\u2019s buildings. Project outcomes seek to save building energy consumption in heating, cooling, and artificial lighting load while producing on-site renewable energy and sequestrating CO2. The biochromic windows, coupled with an intelligent control system, further enhance economic and environmental performance depending on solar intensity and carbon concentration. The view-out area within the biochromic window admits year round daylighting. Proximity to green nature is expected to provide aesthetic quality and emotional comfort for user satisfactions.This award reflects NSF&apos;s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation&apos;s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

        "Abstract": "This SBIR project aims to implement a federated data platform focused on a data system to enable mammography data to be published into a federated catalog from which collaborators can execute federated analyses. It will enable hospitals and other clinical entities to make their data available for training and validation of artificial intelligence applications. The data federation will include a racially, geographically, and socio economically diverse group of contributors that provide data representative of the US population. This diverse data set will provide AI developers with a resource to reduce bias in their algorithms. The platform will include a data discovery portal, governance functions to manage access to the data, and a computational infrastructure to support federated learning and distributed algorithm validation. The platform builds Flywheel\u2019s existing product suite, which includes data management tools for extracting data from clinical information systems, anonymizing the data, and shepherding the data through a comprehensive data curation and quality review workflow. Automated procedures extract rich metadata, which is then shared at an aggregate level to the Flywheel Data Exchange, from which federated data sets and analytic routines are managed."

        "Abstract": "MRIMath technology uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to deliver pixel-level contouring of brain tumors from surrounding healthy tissue to shorten the time it takes to plan radiation treatment, reduce variability among oncologists, and boost patient outcomes. Tumor delineation and quantification remains the weakest link in the search for accuracy in radiotherapy. Inaccuracy and variation in defining critical volumes could compromise treatment outcomes. This critical task is generally performed manually in the clinic. MRIMath is developing an interpretable and trustworthy Physician-in-the-loop AI platform that: i) performs 3D delineation of tumors and organs at risk within the brain with accuracy higher than 90%; ii) outputs an uncertainty map of its prediction that reflects self-assessment of the AI; iii) registers CT-MRI and MRI-MRI pair and group of images; and iv) tracks individual metastases longitudinally. The usability of the software will be evaluated with at least 100 users. Physicians will finish their work in less than 10 minutes and the variability between users will be less than 20%. The project will also perform a large-scale validation study with human medical image data. The MRIMath software - using longitudinal volumetric analysis - detects tumor growth at least 3 months earlier than visual inspection by radiologists."

        "Abstract": "Analog sensors are expected to produce 1020 bits of data per second by 2030, and data transmission for such high volumes of data, especially for wireless transmission, is extremely energy expensive. Digitizing the analog sensor data for transmission to remote location (e.g., cloud server) for processing creates an enormous amount of data that is predicted to grow at exponential rates. Improvements in the transmitter chain, such as higher energy-efficiency analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) or data compression techniques (compressive sensing), are not enough to result in orders-of-magnitude reduction in transmission volume and energy. Instead, addressing the data deluge problem requires re-imagining the entire signal acquisition chain and possibly drawing inspiration from human brain to efficiently extract information from the large volume of sensor data.\nGeneral statement of how this problem is being addressed.\nAlphacore proposes embedding artificial intelligence (AI) locally on-sensor to intelligently determine\/extract information from sensor signals and transmit only meaningful selected segments to achieve reduction in sensor data transmission volume and energy. The driving motivation behind on-sensor AI is to achieve sensor data compression ratios of 105:1 that is only possible through intelligent algorithms that can detect subtle and \u2018rare\u2019 pattern\/information hidden in large volumes of sensor data. In addition, local AI capability lowers latency compared to remote (cloud-based) processing and is critical for applications that need real-time monitoring, such as for predictive maintenance in industrial manufacturing applications where in-sensor AI models can continuously monitor sensor data and look for early signs of malfunction.\nWhat is to be done in Phase I?\nDuring Phase I, Alphacore will meet the following objectives:\nObjective 1: Design of reservoir-computing network for sensor data classification\nObjective 2: Design in-memory computing circuit for read-out layer of reservoir-computer\nObjective 3: Analyze the performance improvements (in terms of data compression and energy reduction) of in-sensor AI across applications\nCommercial Applications and Other Benefits (limited to the space provided).\nAlphacore\u2019s solution will enable sensors to determine and extract selected segments of the data signals, and transmit only the relevant data, achieving reduction in the data transmission volume, and therefore, energy consumption. Given the ubiquitous importance of saving energy, and the continuous demand to achieve as little power consumption as possible without sacrificing system performance, the market opportunity for this innovation is expected to be massive. Applications that will benefit include industrial automation and manufacturing, power and utilities, automotive applications, smart homes and cities, and more Internet-of-Things related applications. The main benefit for all these industries will be increased efficiency and reduced costs in data transmission and communication within the sensor networks, while progressing towards decarbonization and reducing greenhouse gas emissions."

        "Abstract": "Dark Wolf Solutions, LLC (Dark Wolf) proposes the Talent Acquisition aND Knowledge System (TANKS) solution to enable the Army\u2019s Emerging Technology Leaders (ETL) Program to achieve human capital management efficiencies. Our approach capitalizes on our team\u2019s proven successful Agile management approach, deep knowledge of a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and clustering tools, and proven success with operationalizing Artificial Intelligence\/Machine Learning (AI\/ML) research. This approach consists of five steps: (1) Scope the Problem and Further Identify Requirements, (2) Conduct Data Discover, (3) Test and Analyze Results to Select the Optimal ML Model, and (4) Conduct Phase II Planning. Dark Wolf\u2019s proposed TANKS solution will leverage one solution or several combined solutions, such as clustering, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and deep learning, (in an ensemble approach) to provide the Army an easy-to-use tool to identify key skills, recruit and develop talent, and distribute talent across the enterprise. Our solution applies a clustering algorithm to build an ideal ETL profile of Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA). Each of those KSA\u2019s is given a grade based on the average squared error within the cluster. TANKS then uses the KSA scores to build an overall KSA assessment for candidates where missing high grade skills are presented on the user\u2019s profile as potential areas for development. (Talent Development.) In addition to the KSA score, TANKS will leverage deep learning to assess the narrative portions of a candidate&apos;s resume. The TANKS interface will aggregate these scores as well as their narrative score, enabling Army Human Resources professionals to identify highly rated candidates quickly and efficiently. These models, used in conjunction, will reduce overall hiring bias by building a score and profile without factoring in identifying characteristics of a candidate. (Skill Identification, Talent Recruitment, Talent Selection.) Finally, TANKS enables users to associate candidates with a team, and using the members\u2019 individual scores, TANKS will designate an overall team score and skill assessment, identifying strengths and weaknesses. The TANKS teams\u2019 profiles will allow the Army to track teams across the organization and optimally distribute talent. (Talent Distribution.)"

Identify and define unstructured textual information such as resumes, ASVAB and other test scores, evaluation reports, career selection information (e.g., AIM), and unit assignments. Strip out all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and obtain individual release approval for novel metadata. Develop a draft ontology to fingerprint the metadata.\u00a0 3. Develop a construct to quantify cognitive and values-based attributes of ETLs using behavioral analytics tools (VIZEON):\u00a0Identify subjective descriptors of ideal ETL candidates. Use those descriptors, WSI\u2019s online VIZEON assessments, and associated WSI cognitive behavior algorithms to create a template to guide evaluation of the employee sample pool. Use Elsevier FPE to fingerprint cognitive attributes of the sample pool and develop a VIZEON attribute ontology. 4. Develop a construct for text extraction, followed by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and semantic profiling of unstructured metadata text to mine the novel metadata:\u00a0Use NLP, data mining, text mining, and information retrieval processes to develop an AI-based construct of semantic search fingerprints for the novel (sample pool) metadata. Develop initial FPE models through analysis of novel metadata to assess common data elements across the representative (sample) group of personnel. Tune the FPE model and associated ML to accommodate all types of unstructured text including Army HR modules, resumes, transcripts, evaluation reports, and publications.\u00a0 5. Develop a construct to map fingerprints of personnel metadata to Army ETL requirements:\u00a0Using the ontologies, cognitive assessments, and fingerprints created in Tasks 1-4, develop an AI-driven ML model to map personnel data to ETL requirements. Identify and catalog key phrases that emerge from the novel metadata to weight terms and evaluate their relative strength. Create a graduated ranking of personnel data fingerprints against the weighted terms. Use a bracketing approach to achieve an 80th\u00a0\u2013 90th\u00a0percentile probability of best fit for ETL candidate selection using key terms for the requirements ontology and key terms from the personnel fingerprints. Develop an AI-based construct to automate this cognitive computing process. 6. Develop\/present Phase I deliverable."

        "Abstract": "The Army and Technology are inextricable in 2021 - the success of the Army in Great Power Competition is directly correlated to its ability to innovate and implement technology at the speed of war. Technology and innovation, however, are human domains where code alone cannot win wars. Thus, the Army must find technical experts within their formations and elevate them to positions where they can lead technical efforts, represent Soldier-users, and integrate technologies critical to mission outcomes. We must leverage technology, novel approaches, and experience from the private sector to unlock this trapped capacity and hidden talent to find these experts. The Army needs Emerging Technology Leaders (ETLs) to usher in a new era where the Army can integrate critical new technologies like artificial intelligence\/machine learning, autonomy, hypersonics, quantum computing, and many more. Black Cape proposes integrating and tailoring Personifi, a next generation talent management tool suite, providing a novel data centric approach transforming Army talent management. Harnessing modern cloud infrastructure and databasing is a critical step to enable advanced analytics like artificial intelligence. The most vital step in this project is identifying and cataloging the many sources of Soldier data and working collaboratively with Soldiers and existing Army systems (e.g., IPPS-A) to paint a complete picture of the whole person. When available information is assembled and correlated, gaps filled by Soldier inputs can complete the masterpiece. Black Cape has helped the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), and many other Government agencies aggregate this type of data. In support of DIA, Black Cape customized and deployed the Personifi tool as the Career Explorer capability that modernized the DIA\u2019s approach for talent identification, development, and placement. The Personifi Suite combines authoritative HR data (from DIA\u2019s myHR) with mission attributes to provide improved insight on personnel and job opening decisions."

        "Abstract": "Equipping the US military for operations in a rapidly changing world driven by data and technology is extremely difficult given the array of capabilities, threats, technologies, and objectives that are constantly changing. Improved methods for informing decision makers and determining what capabilities are effective against evolving threats are necessary to meet the needs of the warfighter in a timely manner. One effective method that accelerates analysis, concept exploration, and decision making is using Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S). The use of M&amp;S to perform theater-wide mission analysis presents its own set of challenges. No one person, or team, is able to be aware of, mentally retain, or consider the full extent of the DoD\u2019s simulation and modeling capabilities, let alone how they would integrate, leading to an inability to store, find, retrieve, and compose models for a particular need. Previous efforts to characterize, catalog, and compose existing model asset portfolios are inconsistent and prone to taxonomy incompatibilities, manual error, and interoperability issues. There is significant need for tooling that allows a team to represent existing models, catalogue and discover them, and evaluate them for suitability against simulation needs so they can be incorporated into the decision-making process. SimVentions is partnering with KaDSCi LLC and the Old Dominion University \/ Virginia Modeling and Simulation Center (ODU\/VMASK) as Team SimV to address this problem. Team SimV\u2019s prior work and domain expertise across these areas uniquely positions us to create a complete, practical, and useful architecture with workflows, automation, software tools, and data structures. We have demonstrated in our DP2 justification our readiness to apply the data structure approach and knowledge representation strategies for SMR across the aspects of security, representation, model correspondence, model suitability, integration, and management. By applying the tools and techniques of Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Artificial Intelligence, our technical approach will enable the architecture needed to compose multi-mission, multi-domain, kill-web mission analysis in faster than real time. To realize the benefits, Team SimV proposes to build the SMR with four key innovations - a hybrid data storage approach consisting of both structured and unstructured data, a microservice-based classification solution decoupled from the SMR core, an iterative filtering interview workflow to identify relevant assets, and a robust scoring and composition technology. Team SimV\u2019 innovative approaches will enable SMR to effectively identify and classify assets; create an architecture for addressing known types and to manage future unknown types; create a framework to evaluate interoperability and integration gaps; and give an environment to evaluate the level of effort and time to create solutions to theater-wide mission analysis questions."

        "Abstract": "There is currently an explosion of the adoption of embedded devices (esp. around Internet of Things, IoT). Based on recent incidents related to attacks against industrial sensor and wireless networks, there are concerns about significant risks related to the quality of performance of such devices. Additionally, embedded systems requirements testing is typically currently done at the DevOps stage. However, for purchased third-party COTS devices, the buyer is not part of the DevOps process and is not supported by the testing tool landscape. We propose \u201cVeriCoR\u201d (Third Party Verification of COTS Compliance with Requirements), a solution for automated analysis of embedded devices with support for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) operation. The goal of the current system is to achieve outstanding levels of coverage for both device specifications and operator usability, with as much automation as possible. At its heart, our system is driven by a novel Domain Specific Language (DSL) which acts as a bridge between the operator and low-level implementation of instruments performing binary analysis. The analysis results from lifting operations where binaries are made available in formats including Intermediate Representation (IR), Intermediate Language (IL), Assembly (ISA), and high-level programming language (C). In these forms, and relative to platforms including Ghidra and S2E, lifted binary becomes available for analysis in static and dynamic forms. We have previously identified the ability for static analysis to meet code quality, code inclusion, and library import quality standards and specifications. We have previously demonstrated these functions to be fully automated with a binary input and explicit specification of strings, patterns, and dates to include as constraints. As a dedicated cybersecurity company, ObjectSecurity has over 20 years\u2019 experience in evaluating static code representations for security-related specifications and 15 years of experience encoding security policies and specifications in middle and high-level Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). Our proposal is intended to analyze COTS testbed devices covering a variety of industrial use cases as previously carried out for Navy and DoD initiatives. We present novel experimentation, testing, and validation methodologies (including using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, AI\/ML) that will be incorporated for advanced analysis and feedback features to benefit automation and accuracy of fielded systems. Our solution will support a range of operator expertise, from novice to experts, with dedicated DSL IDE support and reporting features including rendering capabilities to concise textual, verbose\/auditable textual, and visual\/graphical outputs. Additional features are outlined to support functional prototype development and support for APIs, customizable device specifications, independent validations, and future enhancements"

        "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is approaching a turning point in which it briskly evolves from a tool for information lookup and processing in knowledge-based tasks to a teammate that monitors the team and its members; and accurately infers beliefs, predicts actions, and executes cognitive work with humans. This will transform individual taskwork, teamwork, and human-machine dynamics on a wide variety of tasks. It will require a capability to assess the extent to which machines consider the current beliefs (mental models) and likely future actions (theory of mind) of human teammates, in much the same way that good human team members build a theory of mind of their partners. The factors that enable teamwork among humans have been well-explored by organizational psychologists, but those that enable teamwork in hybrid, human-AI teams are only emerging. Standardized frameworks to assess an artificial social intelligence\u2019s (ASI\u2019s) capabilities do not yet exist in the way they do for human teammates. Their absence is limiting ASI developers\u2019 ability to quickly understand the consequences of their design choices on the functioning of hybrid teams and is slowing the cycle of development as a result. We propose to develop a system of ASI Measures for Test and Evaluation of Cooperative Communication (ASIM-TECC) to address this current measurement gap for ASI developers. ASIM-TECC consists of (1) a framework defining measures and experimental manipulations of hybrid (human-AI) teams grounded in social and computer science research; (2) software to help select and operationalize measures and manipulations to assess ASI; (3) a baseline ASI that is grounded in a mathematical model of cooperative communication (i.e., how people communicate effectively) and can be configured with varying ASI capabilities; and (4) empirical data validating the measures, manipulations, and model in a domain of DoD interest to include urban search and rescue (USAR), humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HA\/DR), or similar domains. Aptima, Inc., and the Cognitive and Data Science Lab (CoDaS) of Rutgers University Department Of Mathematics and Computer Science will work in close coordination to develop the measure and manipulation frameworks and implementation (1 and 2, led by Aptima) and the modeling (3, led by Rutgers). The Rutgers model is an instance of a potentially powerful ASI that can be used diagnostically to assess the state of a team, and prognostically to estimate the impact of an ASI intervention on the team. Thus, it is an appropriate ASI model to use in validating the measure and manipulation framework (4, by Aptima). The products associated with this effort can be used by developers in combination to understand the behavior and performance of their ASI relative to a validated and modular benchmark ASI, which can help ASI developers address specific needs throughout the design cycle."

        "Abstract": "The Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) has a mandate to digitalize the development process. However, at present it is a complex challenge to measure and digitize dynamic objects without foreknowledge of their geometry at Air Force T&amp;E Centers, such as Eglin, Holloman, and Edwards. The legacy methods rely on manual interpretation with significant man-hours required. As a result, T&amp;E data can be incomplete and inaccurate, often relying on 70 year-old legacy technology of inferring the object\u2019s dynamic performance based on \u201cwhere it lands\u201d after the event via witness panels, catch bundles, and post-event site surveys. After demonstrating the Mechanical Solutions, Inc. (MSI) modern high-speed camera and artificial intelligence digitalization techniques to the Chief of Capability Development for the 846th Test Squadron at Holloman AFB, it was clear that state-of-the-art techniques for unknown-geometry object tracking and characterization will substantially improve T&amp;E digital test data and provide the completeness and accuracy necessary for digital capture of both ejection\/egress and dynamic warhead tests. The digital information can then be used to create a digital development model of the egress ejection seat and dynamic warhead event, which will be translated into a digital engineering approach to the egress ejection seat and warheads and help move the T&amp;E community into the new digital engineering age. The basis for these innovations is the VibVue\u00ae solution, which uses high-speed video to enable its users to characterize and comprehensively understand the sources and effects of object\u2019s complex vibration issues."

We will develop a novel adaptive controller which will impose the correct damping coefficient with the walking speed and payload of the rucksack to optimize the electrical power output and ergonomics.\u00a0In addition to a discrete component solution to optimize power output we will also examine a microprocessor-based Artificial Intelligence approach.\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "Microservices-Based (MB) Radio Frequency (RF) and Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (EMSO) systems\u00a0are the future for the US DoD as evidenced by the numerous MB-EMSO payload development and maturation initiatives across the DAF, Navy, and Army. Further, many defense contractors are developing their own MB-EMSO systems outside the large DAF, Army, and Navy efforts, several of which are aligning with the Sensor\u00a0Open Systems Architecture (SOSA) to improve transition and sustainment success. While these MB-EMSO systems are powerful and flexible, operators must manually configure and reconfigure the systems, which places a tremendous cognitive burden on the operators and their ability to rapidly draw upon their expertise and field knowledge. These MB-EMSO systems are critically dependent upon an operator monitoring and running the systems as well as starting, stopping, and employing software applications, thereby restricting employment to situations where an operator is available full-time. MB-EMSO systems are intended to run semi or fully autonomously, so that warfighters can focus on the most pressing matters, yet to date, MB-EMSO systems all require manual operation. Statheros\u2019 Containerized RF Application Automated Mission Manager (CRAAMM) is a container orchestrator, service mesh, and deployment manager for microservices-based (MB) radio frequency (RF) and Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (EMSO) systems. CRAAMM enables autonomous and rapid reconfiguration and deployment of containerized RF applications based on dynamic environmental events, such as the detection of emergent RF threats, movement through geo-bounded areas, changes in signals of interest (SOIs) or RF threat behaviors, or other unanticipated events in the electromagnetic operating environment (EMOE). CRAAMM is specifically designed to reduce or eliminate the cognitive burden on RF and EMSO system operators by autonomously\u00a0managing and optimizing system resources to maximize system efficacy based on dynamic, real-time EMOE events and activities.\u00a0 Under Phase I, Statheros proved the feasibility of CRAAMM by developing a concept demonstrator and then demonstrating the capability in a virtualized sandbox environment for a DAF EMSO mission system. Under this Phase II effort, Statheros will mature and enhance the Phase I CRAAMM concept demonstrator by expanding artificial intelligence algorithms, developing support for new EMSO mission systems, enhancing inter-application message support, and\u00a0integrating and testing CRAAMM\u00a0with two DAF EMSO mission systems to prepare CRAAMM for transition to Phase III follow-on work with multiple DAF stakeholders."

        "Abstract": "As adversaries to the United States improve their combat aircraft and air defense systems, the Department of the Air Force (DAF) must continuously improve its fleet. An aircraft, when it enters into service, can operate for decades before being decommissioned. During this lifespan, the avionics, flight computers, and other systems receive upgrades to keep aircraft flight ready and mission capable. Software changes, even innocuous updates, take on new import in military systems, where the implications of poorly executed code can have catastrophic results for the pilot, crew, and mission. To mitigate these risks, the 309th Software Engineering Group (309th SWEG), which is responsible for developing \u201ccradle-to-grave\u201d software and hardware support systems, conducts thorough testing before pushing new software to operating aircraft. This process includes recording and reviewing hundreds of hours of video from inside a cockpit testbed to observe the software in operation in a relevant environment. This entire process can add months and sometimes years to mission critical upgrades for aircraft, such as the A-10, F-16, F-22, F-35. Working with 309th SWEG, CrowdAI proposes to leverage human-machine teaming to reduce not only the analytic burden on Airmen to perform this task, but to reduce the time to completion while delivering as good or better results. Computer vision (CV) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to derive meaningful information from digital scenes, such as video\u2014 and to take actions or make recommendations based on that information. The proposed project would\u00a0implement a CV solution to assist Airmen reviewing video\u00a0of the cockpit testbed during software testing. CrowdAI is an industry leader in an advanced CV technique called image segmentation, which analyzes video at the pixel level. This capability is critical given the complexity of the \u201cheads-up display\u201d, which conveys many pieces of information, projected\u00a0onto a dynamic background. CrowdAI was the first company to apply image segmentation to video, earning it the top place in the DAF\u2019s HyperSpace Challenge in 2018 as well as selection by the DOD\u2019s Joint Artificial Intelligence Center as its first CV vendor.\u00a0 For this proposed work, CrowdAI would develop new CV models for use by the 309th SWEG. The project would include gathering relevant video data, labeling relevant objects in that data for the model to learn, and training multiple computer vision models. These models will then be transferred from the development environment to an operations environment not only to explore cross-domain approaches and technical requirements, but to evaluate model performance on production data. AFRL will provide compute resources during this phase. 309th SWEG is the project end-user and transition partner for integrating into the Advanced Battle Management System (Party Bus) for anticipated long-term sustainment and which CrowdAI is already on contract (FA8612-21-D-0117).\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "RTSync proposes to develop a Model-based System Engineering (MBSE) framework based on DEVS Modeling and Simulation (DMBSE) that supports predictive analysis to enhance design, development, testing, and evaluation of complex system of systems with mission threads and workflows. RTSync\u2019s simulation based predictive analytics (SimPA)\u00a0platform will offer predictive capabilities to reduce development, integration, and deployment time and risk of new mission critical applications on autonomy and artificial intelligence (A2I) and lay the foundation for new business models. To achieve this objective, we aim to provide a prototype environment that employs our previously developed Collaborative Architecture for Model Level Integration (CAMLI) to effectively construct, reuse, and adapt families of mission thread and work flow models to evolving requirements. We plan to demonstrate that the prototype DMBSE predictive analytics platform to enhance A2I for better mission-tailored decision support for researchers at Air Force Research Laboratories (AFRL) and other department of defense, government, and commercial customers. Deliverables for the Phase II include a prototype to demonstrate functionality, software design, and web interfaces documents, as well as, demonstration of the prototype and design components integrated into AFRL environment. Our major milestones for this project include: selecting a Mission Thread as the basis for prototype demonstration, developing the model components required for the selected mission thread, extending the theory of modeling and simulation to help locate the most suitable model component or composition in the repository for a given such use. The team will specify metrics to measure relevant aspects of the intended workflow and the results of applying the proposed methodology and software system. \u00a0 The particular goal of the application to AFRL is\u00a0 to improve the pace and rigor at which\u00a0 air force and collaborating forces share and deploy Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI\/ML) technologies in training and operational exercises. This will involve helping AFRL to develop a novel infrastructure that will enable coalition forces to collaboratively discover and reuse AI\/ML for dynamic mission requirements. \u00a0 RTSync\u2019s MBSE-based simulation predictive analytics framework will enable AFRL to formalize mission and infrastructure requirements for planned exercises, discover where agent interactions can be improved, and design better system-integration tests. The Air Force currently lacks engineering methods for the development of large-scale AI\/ML systems that involve a number of different stakeholders with different requirements and policy restrictions, and which span multiple organizations. The proposed framework by RTSync will advance the Air Force\u2019s agility to rapidly train, test, and integrate state-of-the-art AI\/ML into operations at the speed and scale necessary for 21st century warfare. \u00a0"

        "Abstract": "The global operations of the United States Air Force are critical to national security. Although the advancement and proliferation of domains such as robotics and artificial intelligence are lessening our Nation\u2019s reliance on human staffing, many operations still require servicemembers to perform arduous tasks and train within environments that expose them to various physical, cognitive, and environmental stressors and risks. These stressors present both acute and chronic dangers, and unfortunately, fatalities have occurred in the recent past. Despite the cruciality of these tasks and the Airmen\u2019s status the most important asset of the USAF, there is a considerable lack of technology to quantify, personalize, and predict human health and safety risks in these environments and tasks. To address this need, Sentinel will extend its SafeGuard platform for mission-critical USAF operations to provide personalized and proactive health and safety monitoring to Airmen in challenging operational and training environments. Specific examples of such environments, tasks, and associated risk factors include confined spaces operations, heat stress and overexertion, lone warfighter operations and training, noise exposure, pilot health monitoring, and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high-yield Explosives (CBRNE) exposure."

        "Abstract": "Phelps2020 will adapt\u00a0its\u00a0USSOCOM developed SAM real-time Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution that performs accurate Electro-Optical persistent surveillance and automatic detection of threats (people and vehicles) in the presence of jitter and atmosphere turbulence. Our solution performs automatic and concurrent mitigation of several environmental degradations, including low light, fog, haze, blur, high dynamic range, backlighting, low resolution, and atmospheric distortions, which were shown to highly improve the accuracy of threat detection and reduce false alarms. Convolutional Neural networks-based Object detection (OD), the second component of DAR-DVE, has been traditionally used with EO sensors for lack of data in the IR. Phelps\u2019 base product Crystal already extends EO-based OD to the majority of low light situations (dusk, dawn, and many nighttime situations). We will extend AI to the infrared bands for moonless nights, and retrain our existing AI OD algorithms for Geospatial AI to detect new classes, potentially including weapons, surface to air missile systems or other peer Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS) in the visible and in the infrared, while associating the same objects in both bands for increased accuracy and improved intelligence."

        "Abstract": "Increasingly complex and sophisticated threat systems and complicated mission areas and planning parameters pose an ever-growing challenge for mission and weapon planners. Compounding the problem are legacy processes and software such as the Joint Mission Planning Software (JMPS), which cannot adequately process and incorporate the large quantity of data necessary for modern mission planning. GBL Systems proposes the Weapons Automated Artificial Intelligence Planner (WAAP), a layered technology approach that applies modern automation and machine learning (ML) techniques to this complex mission\/weapons planning domain. WAAP scales gracefully with increasing mission complexity and seamlessly incorporates vast quantities of data while reducing planner cognitive burden, increasing weapons planning throughput, and providing robust extensibility. The WAAP design builds upon proven artificial intelligence (AI) and ML technology to improve Weapons Strike Planning for the Next-Generation Open Mission System (NOMS) architecture. WAAP will eschew computationally expensive exhaustive search, instead rapidly providing \u201coptimal enough\u201d solutions within reasonable planning timeframes to meet mission and weapons planning goals. Three critical components will be featured. First, a Synthetic Data Generation Harness can process and encapsulate \u201cblack box\u201d legacy weapon flyout models. Second, a Learner that can analyze unstructured and structured data alike, featuring advanced automated machine learning. Third, a Replica that iteratively improves weapons planning using ML models and AI techniques. \u00a0 WAAP will address five key Improvement Areas for NOMS and weapons planning: Increasing process automation to eliminate manual weapons planning and decrease planning times while improving quality of results; Development of core weapons planning capabilities via a microservice architecture to result in a more robust and reliable planning experience that can quickly be updated; Integrating ML and AI for weapons delivery and threat avoidance with a continually enhanced planning workflow; Developing a next-generation flyout model service for common weapon models that enable the quick and easy extension for new weapons; And, producing results that can be applied to existing seamless cloud services linking essential mission data from multiple sources to facilitate automated weapon planning processes. GBL will leverage its prior SBIR and commercial technologies to reduce development risk and increase the feasibility ofsuccessful extensibility and transition of WAAP software products."

Foreign personnel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s background, criminal histories, and other decision criteria are often unavailable to USG security experts charged with making critical force protection and base access decisions. Legacy tools and technologies are limited by their inability to assess foreign persons for insider risks and are unable to uncover amplifying information to enhance the investigative processes. Air Force and Combatant Commander security personnel are conducting research and development (R&amp;D) for technologies to deliver an improved, holistic risk picture that works in parallel to existing vetting processes. Clearspeed&apos;s artificial intelligence (AI) enabled voice analytics technology has transformed how commercial organizations in the insurance, banking, technology, and hiring arenas screen personnel to detect fraud, IP theft, good hires, and insider risk. After successful government evaluations, scientific peer-reviewed articles, endorsements from top scientific voice experts, and a recently completed formal study - Clearspeed is poised to transform one of the USG\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toughest vetting challenges."

Greetly&apos;s prior Phase II solution will be further extended and scaled with additional TACFI funding. Through our work with the 96 SFS at Eglin AFB during our Phase II, we have developed software infrastructure, interface, and workflows that enable Sponsors, Security Managers, and Security Forces personnel to exercise real-time control of 100% of the visitor authorizations within their approval hierarchies. The main goals of our involvement in this project are: a) Increase the scalability of the Phase II prototype, so that it may be deployed \u201coff the shelf\u201d to nearly all Air Force installations without requiring additional development or customizations. b) Construct a zero-trust identity authentication system for 100% of non-CAC holders (visitors) to verify access authorization and credentials. This mechanism will be based on USAF trusted private key credentialing, paired against a visitor forgery and spoof resistant identity mechanisms. c) To create an immutable, auditable database of visitor behavior events, with access detail extended to restricted areas such as secure facilities, flight lines, and munitions zones. Behavior events may include entry\/exit history, location data, access events, and passive detection systems. d) To prepare this database for future application of machine learning \/ artificial intelligence (ML\/AI) programs to conduct outlier detection and predictively notify installation commanders of emerging security threats. e) To prepare this database for export to Air Force directed systems of record such as the Defense Biometric Information System (DBIDS). f) To prepare this database for export to Common Operating Picture systems used by commanders and emergency responders, such as ATAK, C2IMERA, and COPERS. g) To enable the above in a zero-touch environment, allowing the ability to instantly posture for future pandemics requiring contactless procedures and accurate contact tracing."

        "Abstract": "The Personnel Recovery (PR) mission is vital to effectively plan and conduct military operations in overseas theaters. The military effort to prepare for and successfully execute the recovery of isolated personnel (IPs) is essential to maintaining force readiness, denying enemy critical intelligence, and protecting the lives of U.S. service members. The USAF is often a leader among services in integrating new PR resources and adopting new innovative technologies. Cutting-edge developments in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have created an opportunity to advance current PR planning resources and operational PR support products. Deep Learning (DL) approaches are highly effective at identifying temporal and spatial patterns in geospatial data. Reinforcement Learning (RL) can discover successful behaviors and decisions in realistic military simulations. \u00a0If harnessed effectively, AI and ML technologies can equip PR planners, coordinators, and IPs with a significant technological advantage over their adversaries. However, new technologies are often tough to deploy at scale. Broad-based adoption is difficult across large military and government organizations. Human behavior is challenging to model. To meet these challenges, Machina Cognita Technologies (MCT) proposes the Spatial-Temporal Agent-based Motion Prediction and Evasion Decision Engine (STAMPEDE). STAMPEDE will be designed to provide users at each level of the joint PR C2 architecture with guidance through an enhanced suite of DL-powered planning and coordination aids. The STAMPEDE system will ingest a wide array of data sources that characterize PR scenarios. STAMPEDE will be compatible with LandSAR mobility model plugin data and incorporate new dynamic data sources. STAMPEDE will return IP location probability maps at sequenced time intervals back to decision support tools.\u00a0 Accompanied by easily interpreted explanations, recommended evasion decisions that avoid capture will be output directly to PR planners and coordinators. STAMPEDE will enable PR planners and coordinators to identify exclusion zones that reduce SAR search areas and drive more efficient searches through spatial-temporal human motion pattern discovery. STAMPEDE\u2019s IP evasion movement recommendations will guide AOR evasion plans of action (EPAs) and theater wide PR guidance using ML-powered prediction and recommendation tools. STAMPEDE will generate customized evasion planning and decision guidance tailored to specific threat scenarios, real-world geographically bounded locations, and individual IP mobility behaviors and circumstances. STAMPEDE\u2019s evasion decision explanations will instill PR user trust in and drive greater PR user adoption of the system using intuitive ML explainability models. STAMPEDE will empower PR users to reduce operational costs and increase the likelihood of successful evasion, survival and recovery through ML model location predictions and evasion decisions recommendations."

        "Abstract": "To address the Air Force\u2019s need for a non-destructive inspection (NDI) system for silicon nitride ceramic bearings that is significantly faster and more cost-effective than current systems, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes to develop a new Multispectral Automated Roller and Ball Bearing Inspection System Using Machine Learning (MARBIL) that uses both multispectral imaging to detect all potential flaws in the bearing, including surface and interior flaws, without requiring any liquid penetrant and machine learning (ML) algorithms to rapidly distinguish faulty bearings from acceptable ones. MARBIL\u2019s ML-based imaging approach can accommodate multiple sizes of rolling elements, both rollers and ball designs, as well as bearings of different materials, including different ceramics and metal. This allows a single MARBIL unit to inspect all possible bearings at a production facility, significantly reducing costs compared to those at facilities that utilize specialized NDI systems. Its ML algorithms allow for training at a fraction of the time and cost required for conventional artificial intelligence training, further reducing the cost of the system. Furthermore, MARBIL\u2019s parallelization approach for imaging and image processing minimizes the overall inspection time and supports a high throughput of bearings. In Phase I, Intellisense will demonstrate the feasibility of MARBIL by constructing a proof-of-concept system and documenting its ability to meet the minimum flaw size and probability of inspection requirements established by the Air Force. Intellisense will also develop an initial transition and business plan for further development. During Phase II, Intellisense will validate the methodology developed in Phase I for conditions replicating those found in practice with physical testing and show feasible build processes and stable quality assurance processes. Intellisense will also work with interested original equipment manufacturers and bearing suppliers to begin transitioning the technology to production facilities. By the conclusion of Phase II Intellisense expects to have a demonstrator model complete and validated in one or more production facilities in preparation for full MARBIL production."

        "Abstract": "The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques, such as deep learning, to radio frequency (RF) systems, opens enormous new opportunities to improve communications, sensors, intelligence gathering, and electronic warfare. One major challenge is to figure out how to effectively test and evaluate (T&amp;E) such systems. With sufficient knowledge and expertise, it is generally possible to predict how conventional RF systems will behave given a certain set of conditions and to establish verification, validation, and accreditation (VV&amp;A) policies based on that knowledge. For deep learning-based systems, it is extremely difficult for a human to predict what the output will be, making it extremely difficult to develop appropriate VV&amp;A policies. Charles River Analytics proposes to design and prototype Reliable AI Explanations for Testing and Evaluation of Radiofrequency Systems (RAETERS), a test and evaluation capability to establish the performance and reliability of machine learning-based radiofrequency systems using a multi-stage adversarial model inversion approach to explain the behavior of the system under test and establish performance metrics with operationally relevant simulations. RAETERS will use adversarial model inversion to generate explanations and calculate performance and reliability metrics for deep learning-based RF systems to establish that such systems operate as intended."

Understanding the reasoning behind a logical result can provide a level of validity and reliability that may not be readily apparent. \u00a0In recent years, radio frequency communications have used machine learning. Research has moved from classical, iterative signal classification algorithms to applications of Deep Neural Networks. RFML implementations will continue to improve in terms of classification performance and real-time classification capability. AI algorithms, however, need to be explainable to allow for sufficient levels of Test and Evaluation for a system to be declared \u201coperational\u201d and be deployed with the warfighter in radar, electronic warfare, ELINT, and SIGINT operations. This effort will commence with the analysis of explainability methodologies and novel metrics for AI analysis applied to the RF domain.\u00a0 The envisioned process will establish feasibility and plan for the development of a means to explain and measure AI\u00a0 for RF data.\u00a0 The research program focuses on producing a unique set of explainability AI methodologies and metrics, a quantification of the validity and reliability of the RFML explainability method, and an exploration of the needs for near real-time implementation to be applicable to fielded RFML systems. \u00a0"

        "Abstract": "The major advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in the past ~10 years have been the result of the progress in so-called deep learning (neural) networks (DLNs). Moreover, several recent Air Force (AF) projects have demonstrated the efficacy of DLNs for very advanced radio frequency (RF) applications of direct relevance to some of the most critical AF missions including Intelligence, Reconnaissance, &amp; Surveillance (ISR), and Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) against near-peer Integrated Air Defense Systems (IADS). RF sensing applications that have shown significant progress include advanced air-borne\/spaceborne ISR radar (look-down), Electronic Intelligence (ELINT), and Radar Warning Receivers (RWR). However, to ultimately transition these technologies to operational status, Test &amp; Evaluation (T&amp;E) methods must be developed that meet the rigorous reliability and sustainability goals that have long been established by the Department of Defense (DoD) T&amp;E community. A fundamental obstacle to the direct adoption of DLN based AI solutions is the relatively \u201cblack box\u201d nature of DLNs. \u201cUnderstanding\u201d how a DLN is making decisions is the focus of so-called Explainable AI (XAI) research. Even if some measure of understanding is achieved, to meet accepted criteria for DoD weapon system availability (referred to as Ao, pronounced \u201cA-sub-O\u201d), rigorous statistical evidence must also be provided that establishes the statistical reliability of the new system. In this proposal, a new comprehensive and end-to-end (E2E) approach to designing, developing, testing, and validating DLN AI solutions for advanced RF applications is presented. At its core is an advanced RF Digital Engineering (DE) engine built on the highly successful RFView\u2122 family of DE products: Mod &amp; Sim, Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL), etc. The high-fidelity, physics-based, and vetted RF solver (VHF through Ku bands) enables both voluminous synthetic data, and a virtual reality (VR) environment to overcome the fundamental \u201cdata starved\u201d limitations of real-world military systems attempting to utilize DLN AI methods. This new approach allows for unprecedented levels of virtual (and augmented \u201clive-over-sim\u201d) flight tests both purely digital and hybrid via the HIL options. Thus, even real world and real-time hardware\/software issues can be thoroughly fleshed out without prohibitively expensive flight testing. This new approach also allows for extensive \u201cexcursion-from-baseline\u201d analysis to ensure the final product is robust to potentially unforeseen operating conditions. This kind of excursion analysis is simply too expensive and impractical to be conducted via actual flight tests. The development of robust excursion test vectors can be assisted with other AI techniques. Lastly, but critically, this DE environment allows for the generation of sufficient test vectors to achieve any prescribed level of statistical reliability as required to establish a given weapon system availability, Ao"

        "Abstract": "The United States Air Force (USAF) through the SBIR topic AF221-0029 has expressed an interest in a user-friendly software suite that allows a user to quickly and efficiently extract insights from large experimental or simulation-based time-dependent datasets. Such a capability is crucial in compressing and accelerating the design cycle of military aircraft to meet rapidly emerging high-technology security threats. To address this need, Spectral Energies (SE) proposes to develop a suite of tools to perform on-the-fly (in situ) and post-processing of data, depending on the user\u2019s need. The steps include data handling, operator-aware and data-driven decompositions, time-frequency, and physics-based analyses along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches to provide the user with insight to ultimately aid in decision making. To accomplish this, SE will develop a proof-of-concept software solution in Phase I and a prototype\/alpha version of the software in Phase II. It will distribute the software to a select USAF users for evaluation and will make efforts in the future to scale up the software to take advantage of the DoD\u2019s high-performance computing (HPC)."

        "Abstract": "Business Enterprise Systems Product INnovation (BESPIN) has a national defense-related mission need in the area of Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Specifically, a holistic and agile solution driven by innovation, that delivers a scalable end-to-end RPA, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) automation approach is needed to enable our Warfighter\u2019s to become operationally resilient and focus on higher-level tasks. In the past RPA was used by commercial organizations to streamline back-office burdens by removing monotonous tasks, therefore speeding up the supply chain and providing a more effective use of manpower. Today, our Warfighter\u2019s are facing a manpower intensive environment coupled with unprecedented workloads, and a confluence of remote challenges. Currently, the BESPIN Digital University (Digital U) education platform transforms the way 18,000 users complete technical training. Further, Digital U is challenged by an expensive siloed automation that is currently relying on a large scale of people for general knowledge and process functions. Therefore, we believe the technology development under the subject SBIR topic may eventually contribute to solving a mission need. The main goal of our involvement in this project is to provide a holistic and agile RPA+AI solution that allows robotic automation to be a strategic enabler for Digital U, by leveraging data services and end-to-end process and efficiency for our Warfighters. This innovative solution will reduce human intervention, improve task execution efficiency, and drastically decrease labor and operational costs. The mission impact of this project on the Air Force and the DoD will position BESPIN to develop and implement a series of bots designed to automate transactional, rule-based human tasks by mimicking user interactions without any intervention. These robots will implement algorithms to not only complete human repetitive tasks, but reduce errors and downtime, and increase the return on investment (ROI)."

Clarifai is a world leader in the field of Computer Vision (CV), and its employees have published in many peer-reviewed venues garnering tens of thousands of citations. We have a proven track record of adapting our commercial solutions for government purposes, as shown with our participation in Project Maven and our work with other government clients. The People&apos;s Liberation Army (PLA) assumes we cannot read their language, and they are correct. This is primarily due to limited Mandarin linguists, long training pipelines, and a lack of high TRL technologies capable of providing real-time exploitation of\u00a0 Mandarin, Smart Cities, and A2AD platforms. To counter &amp; exploit, AFSOC will need to develop a seamless UX Platform for end-users requiring best-in-breed natural language processing (NLP). Clarifai&apos;s AI tech stack helps tag, analyze, and process the translated data sources and speed up targeting cycles. The benefits of using machine learning on top of best-in-breed NLP will help Analysts speed up the intent behind contextual data and language.\u00a0 Additionally, allowing Clarifai to work on the front end and back end UX, intel communities, and operators can significantly reduce workforce, speeding up targeting cycles.\u00a0 With AI-powered automated metadata generation, improving cataloging descriptions and asset searchability will help build intelligent searches based on objects, people, color, emotions, and even demographic characteristics. With rich metadata tagging, intel communities and operators will be able to understand not just what&apos;s in assets but also how it&apos;s used, where it&apos;s used, who&apos;s viewing it, and their relationships with each other. With a single AI platform, users are given the ability to build and train custom AI models at scale and establish workflows to manage the metadata generation process."

Counterfactuals enable a user to better understand the agent\u2019s limitations and understand why it chose a given path. This comparison of counterfactual or hypothetical future events enables global post-hoc explanation of the RL agent, intended to build trust in the RL agent overall rather than explain a single agent decision."

        "Abstract": "To address the Air Force need to significantly enhance rogue signal detection and classification using AI, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes in Phase II, to advance the development of the Trusted Artificial Intelligence Network for Communications and Radar (TAINCOR) system based on a novel hardened and robust deep neural network (DNN) architecture which can be deployed on a low-size, -weight, and -power (SWaP) system and can process RF data at &gt;200 Hz (99% accuracy; (4) demonstrate that TAINCOR algorithms can be run OTA in real time in a man-portable prototype. In Phase II, Intellisense plans to evaluate the proposed solution against the objectives and measurable key results defined in the Phase I feasibility study. Intellisense will apply the lessons learned investigating the art of the possible in Phase I to mature the technology to directly address Air Force requirements and objectives. Specifically, during the Phase II effort Intellisense will develop, install, integrate, and demonstrate the TAINCOR prototype system and apply this prototype to operational Air Force problems by: (1) training and validating TAINCOR algorithms on data from relevant Air Force systems including radar systems and tactical radios; (2) packaging and maturing the TAINCOR code base to be deployed at scale for both algorithm training and inference; (3) executing on a clear transition path for TAINCOR to be integrated with existing and future Air Force systems. The Phase II effort will prepare TAINCOR for transition in Phase III to Air Force and DoD customers, addressing their needs for signal detection and classifications for radar and RF communication applications."

GALT\u2019s combined key personnel include former USAF C2 professionals and software experts\u00a0in cognitive services and big data processing, C2 applications and artificial intelligence. Ultimately, AVEO Phase II is about refining the solution to make AI real, today and to showcase across the Command and Control enterprise the multitude of additional use cases possible.\u00a0AVEO is a flexible, voice and speech based, query system that creates dynamic, on demand, relevant information for the Air Battle Manager operator and decision maker. AVEO can access information across the multi-domain battlespace. The warfighter software tools of today are a highly complex set of independent and interdependent software systems to plan and execute air, land, sea, subsurface, space and cyber wars. These systems ingest many sources of data, and the need for timely and accurate retrieval of this data can often be thwarted by cumbersome and slow processes. AVEO (a) provides a much more reliable record of dialogue between pilots and Air Battle Managers, (b) significantly reduces potential for human error in Multi-Domain Command and Control decision making, and (c) creates a solid base of information and programming that can be implemented into more advanced AI and ML based applications and software going forward.\u00a0\u00a0"

However,\u00a0most reinforcement learning approaches require hundreds of millions or even billions of training samples to achieve high performing policies. In this paper we propose a novel model based reinforcement learning algorithm call Model Zero that constructs a world model learned from a lower\u00a0fidelity simulation and transfers the world model into a high fidelity simulation. Model Zero leverages its existing knowledge learned from a low fidelity simulation and continues to learn a more accurate world model after being transferred\u00a0into the high fidelity simulation. A key advantage of using our model based reinforcement learning approach is that the methods are general and can be applied to various deterministic\u00a0 high-fidelity physics based environments where training samples are computationally expensive to obtain."

        "Abstract": "Modern Intelligence has developed CUTLASS, a modular, all-sensor, all-platform maritime surveillance AI that classifies, tracks, and predicts objects of interest, their movement and activities over space and time, maintaining custody over distinct sensors and platforms. CUTLASS utilizes state of the art multimodal machine learning models to combine near-simultaneous data streams of separate modalities into a single multichannel tensor. What this means to our Air Force end users is any data stream that features sensors operating in separate spectrums from an ISR asset are combined into a single \u201cimage\u201d CUTLASS uses to understand, classify, and track targets. Electro-optical, Full Motion Video, and infrared sensors provide valuable information on their own, but combined, our models are able to pull out more information on the targets than either sensor is on its own. Because CUTLASS is a pure AI model that is platform and sensor agnostic, the capability is deployable anywhere within the ISR environment, on premise, in the cloud, or at the edge, delivering a solution to the Air Force\u2019s global persistent awareness challenges."

        "Abstract": "ZAC\u2019s disruptive Cognitive Explainable-AI (artificial intelligence) detailed 3D image recognition technology will be adapted to intelligently track target objects of interest (e.g., passenger vehicles) automatically in real-time within aerial video feeds from UAV (e.g., MQ-9), based on the target\u2019s detailed description (which is critical for Intelligent Tracking). This proposed solution will significantly enhance USAF ISR capability to automatically, accurately, and robustly track the target across viewing interruptions and varying orientations and scenery, within the UAV video feed, to hand off tracking to other UAV feeds, or to automatically search through vast amounts of archived feeds captured by persistent ISR, to provide decision quality results. ZAC\u2019s breakthrough detailed image recognition, based on our Explainable-AI, is a demonstrated technology, capable of detecting fine details in images taken at various camera angles (3D), overcoming the major limitations of neural networks which fail to recognize details beyond very generic categories or classifications, and thus, fail to distinguish between similar vehicles. ZAC\u2019s approach beat ResNet (a state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)) in recognizing fine details of complex 3D objects in images, where ResNet completely failed to learn such fine features during its training. In addition, ZAC breakthrough algorithms, as demonstrated in projects with Bosch and USAF, require only a few training samples (much smaller than other algorithms) and much lower computational power, making it practical for edge computing, e.g., on-board UAS, which is one of the mission\u00a0needs of AFSOC\/A5K (Unmanned ISR Requirements). ZAC has successfully completed a project for ZAC Locator with MQ-9 Program Office (AFLCMC\/WIIZ, Medium Altitude UAS Special Projects Branch) to automatically locate objects (passenger vehicles)\u00a0from aerial images. ZAC also has an ongoing project with the same program office for ZAC Describer for recognizing detailed description of passenger vehicles automatically, which is critical to distinguish between similar looking vehicles. The proposed solution, as one of its objectives, integrates both ZAC Locator and ZAC Describer with Intelligent Tracking to find, fix, and track a target vehicle within the same feed or other video feeds. The attached customer memorandum (MOU) from the same Program Office supports the\u00a0current proposal. ZAC won \u201cEngage-Space Challenge\u201d 2020 competition by the US Air Force (AFWERX) for the space industry, as one of the 26 finalists, out of the original 800 teams (i.e., among about the top 3%). Letter of Support from AFRL Space Vehicles Directorate is included.\u00a0 ZAC was recognized as the Top 5 Leading Global Companies in the 4th Industrial Revolution, by Oxford Academic in 2021. ZAC team includes world-renowned researchers\/advisors, including Prof.\u00a0David Lee (Nobel Prize in Physics) and General Michael Moseley, USAF (ret), the USAF 18th Chief of Staff."

        "Abstract": "America\u2019s technological advantage is eroding. USAF Gen Paul J. Selva, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has warned that the Chinese military could reach technological parity with the United States in the early 2020s and outpace the Pentagon in the 2030s, if the U.S. military doesn\u2019t respond to the challenge. And the DoD is woefully outpaced in hiring the kinds of career and technical education (CTE) and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) that America needs in order to compete with Beijing. In drafting the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, the House Appropriations Committee noted that they are \u201cconcerned that Department of Defense recruiting and retention programs are not as effective as they could be to employ personnel for the challenging types of vacancies the department and the services have.\u201d To help address the shortcoming, the 2022 NDAA includes a provision that requires the DoD to establish a Defense CTE and STEM Education and Workforce Pipeline Strategy. In order to maintain our technological advantage, America must speed up the pace of innovation and ensure that our workforce is ready for the transformational skills of the 21st century: artificial intelligence, big data, quantum computing, and robust analytics. But America needs more than just experts in these fields, it needs the operational skills to synthesize and frame problems in combination with the robust background of data fluency and technological know-how. The 2020 DoD Data Strategy outlines an urgent need to update the talent and culture of the DoD to ensure that the \u201cworkforce (Service Members, Civilians, and Contractors at every echelon) will be increasingly empowered to work with data, make data-informed decisions, create evidence-based policies, and implement effectual processes.\u201d This is where Workera.ai helps solve the next big challenge in technical, data and AI training for the Air Force: delivery of far-reaching, highly effective, time-efficient training in data and AI skills. Workera.ai is an objective skills assessment and guidance platform that can assess an individual\u2019s mastery in hundreds of micro-skills needed for jobs in AI and data analytics. Workera.ai\u2019s algorithms then provide an incredibly detailed list of open-source educational resources for a learner to fill in the individual gaps they may have, providing a highly efficient pathway for users to review only the skills they need without repeating coursework they already know. For this Phase II project, Workera.ai will expand its platform, which already includes learning domains across data analysis and AI topics, to create new domains for SAF\/SAA (Analysis Community Development and Support Directorate) in Applied Statistics, Decision Analysis, Simulation, Optimization, Probabilistic Methods, Cost Analysis, and Wargaming."

        "Abstract": "Web Weasels (WW) is a multi-pronged RDT&amp;E program designed to meet one of the stated goals from the USAF\u2019s 2030 Science &amp; Technology Strategy document: \u201cOverwhelm adversaries with complexity, unpredictability, and numbers through a collaborative and autonomous network of systems and effects\u201d The near-peer conflict environment is far deadlier to 4th Gen air systems and even 5th Gen can be challenged through cyber and EW methods. The next DoD \u2018Offset\u2019 calls for smart, autonomous, and connected munitions to prepare, seize and maintain air superiority over the Battlespace. WW builds on a unique swarm planning and deployment capability (Air Commons\u00ae - Swarm or AC-S) by applying cutting edge AI\/ML training techniques and edge computing. WW redefines a \u2018smart bomb\u2019 to be a highly trained, thinking, reactive, and team-playing asset in the fight. In addition, WW has been built to address the AFRL 2022 SBIR requirements: \u201cThe Armament Directorate is pursuing ideas that permit Blue Forces to command various collaborative weapons systems and coordinated tactics to ensure success. A dynamic battlespace requires automated, adaptive weapons systems and cooperative tactics\u2026 Artificial intelligence algorithms with \u201cdialable\u201d human influence\u2026\u201d Squadrons of autonomous collaborative munitions operating at the far edge of the C2 infrastructure, need the training, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to handle the speed-of-datalink environment that occurs in modern combat. Teamwork, communication, shared mental models, and a robust set of tried and tested strategies are required to survive and to dominate. The parent program, AC-S, allowed commanders to plan, task and manage multiple swarming assets through a \u2019Swarm ATO\u2019 and a Swarm Engine. WW is designed to overlay AI\/ML training algorithms onto AC-S to provide pre-launch munitions with a series of TTPs in a \u2018Playbook\u2019 for a given mission set (i.e., SEAD). The munitions will launch with AI-on-the-Edge hardware, firmware and comms architecture (OXYGEN and DROIDISH\u2122) which allows them to collaboratively assess the combat environment, vote on the most suitable Play, call an \u2018Audible\u2019 change, and execute the improved plan. WW uses three teams, one building and training AI\/ML Playbook algorithms; one focused on AI-on-the-Edge, voting and Audibles; and the third one testing Human-Swarm Interfaces (HSwI) configurations. WW will use AirSim to run trial iterations and Mission Rehearsals, and then fly suitably equipped small UAS (emulating autonomous stand-off munitions) against Liteye System\u2019s SHIELD Counter-UAS systems (emulating an Enemy Force integrated radar threat) in the time-honored traditional mission sets of the original USAF Wild Weasels: \u201cFirst In, Last Out\u201d."

        "Abstract": "When quickly deployed into the hands of the warfighter, smart, low-cost expendable platforms are becoming essential to military operations by providing an asymmetric effect on the battlefield. This asymmetric capability has been recently demonstrated in Ukraine by the success of loitering munitions like Switchblades and Phoenix Ghosts. Rapidly evolving technologies in these small, expendable systems pose challenges to developers as well as users including development time, cybersecurity threats, and the Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) optimization. To reduce development time, Digital Engineering (DE) techniques are necessary to rapidly explore and refine possible solutions. Technologies developed using DE must be translated from simulation to reality on a rapid scale to advance the state of the art in autonomous systems and provide real-world validation. To produce the numbers needed, the SWaP-C of these systems must be minimized by leveraging low-cost commercial processing hardware. This optimization becomes more challenging as increased computational requirements of these systems are needed to host advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI\/ML) technologies. While open systems standards such as the Weapon Open Systems Architecture (WOSA) enable mixing \u201cbest of breed\u201d software from different sources, AI\/ML algorithms come from many sources with varying development pedigrees. As a result, this high value AI\/ML software must be protected along with other Critical Program Information (CPI) and execute in a secure environment to isolate complex software components that may contain malicious code. These small, expendable systems need to react quickly to changing operational conditions by enabling rapid technology insertion without compromising cybersecurity. In the proposed program, the Secure AI Processing Platform for Expendable Systems (SAPPES) solution will be developed. The solution will enhance AFRL\u2019s AFSIM with processor and AI hardware digital twin capabilities to enable direct transition of the code developed in simulation secure, low SWaP-C, embedded computing hardware. The SAPPES embedded software architecture will be based on Secmation\u2019s Anneal architecture, in development for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), integrated with Secmation\u2019s SoCrypt, in development for AFRL RV, to provide a Secret and Below (SAB) encryption capability. The hardware will be based on the Xilinx Versal AI Edge System on Chip (SoC). This recently released COTS device provides advanced AI acceleration and comes from a processor family used in secure DoD applications. The Versal AI Edge hardware enhanced by the Secmation\u2019s advanced, purpose-built DoD security architecture capable of supporting classified information will result in a Secure AI Processing Platform. The program will conclude with integration and demonstration of SAPPES on a seeker processor in the AFRL Munitions Open Architecture Test and Evaluation Lab (MOATEL)."

Istari\u2019s overall goal is to integrate many digital engineering tools and models, align them via our Artificial Intelligence Multiplexer, and use their combined outputs to meet certification and regulatory requirements. \u00a0This effort focuses on SysML and M&amp;S input coordination via APIs.\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "Emerging threat environments and adversary capabilities, coupled with the extreme cost of advance weapon systems, present a challenge to continued USAF dominance in potential future conflicts. Advances in autonomy and Artificial Intelligence, allowing the use of large teams of lower-cost weapon assets while managing the required operator workload, offer a potential solution to manage capability at scale within budget, schedule, and manpower constraints. EpiSci\u2019s Starling program will demonstrate the ability to perform demanding autonomous missions, integrate with operators as part of a manned-unmanned team, and demonstrate modular portability for a variety of platforms and missions. While previous autonomy efforts have used bespoke simulation environments, Starling will demonstrate open architecture integration with common and validated USAF modeling and simulation tools such as the Weapons Open System Architecture (WOSA), allowing for independent verification of performance and rapid adoption into diverse vehicles and missions. Built on a Digital Engineering framework with agile DevSecOps practices, Starling will delivery low-cost and low-risk capabilities. Upon successful completion, Starling algorithms will provide portable, trustable, and high-performance autonomous behaviors which are ready for integration into programs and platforms of record."

        "Abstract": "Approximately 40% of combat wounds become infected that can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality. The patient is often given broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment, prior to identification of the pathogen, or the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, contributing to antimicrobial resistance. Delivery of a targeted, real-time wearable device to monitor wound infection on the battlefield and beyond would increase the survival rate of the warfighter, reduce suffering, enable effective use of antimicrobials, and treatment costs alike. The turnaround time for gold standard culture-based testing and molecular methods takes several days and is not feasible for routine monitoring of patient progress. There is currently no FDA-approved, deployable device for real-time and early detection of wound infections and pathogen identification suitable for both the field environments and hospital settings that are telemedicine-capable. Nanobiofab proposes a Real-time Agnostic Patch for Infection Detection (RAPID) using a small, lightweight, noninvasive, AI-powered wearable intelligent Nose (called the \u201cRAPID-iNoseTM\u201d). This patch integrates a wireless high-sensitive nanosensor array and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for in situ, continuous sensing of complex microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) released by pathogens. The device allows for rapid data collection (within 1 min), and identification and differentiation of wound pathogens (Gram+ or Gram \u2013 bacteria and tentatively fungi) for use throughout the continuum of care in the field, home, and clinical settings including transportation. The RAPID-iNose\u2019s small footprint enables integration into wound dressings systems, hypothermia bags, or transport chambers with on-demand wirelessly tracking and monitoring of infection development and progression to optimize resources. Data can be shared with medical professionals in real-time to realize more accurate and appropriate treatment. Importantly, the ability to discern the less common fungal wound infection from those of bacterial infections would enable monitoring of fungal infections and enable correct treatment.\u00a0 Phase I feasibility studies will empower RAPID-iNose design and development of proof-of-concept prototypes and establish reasonable qualitative infection signal detection of pathogens and identify a pre-clinical animal model for use in Phase II. Phase I-II transition will permit prototype miniaturization. Phase II will allow for the execution of the advanced prototype development of the RAPID-iNose, evaluate the device for pathogen detection in vitro and in vivo, and Q-submission for meeting and feedback from the FDA CDRH-regulated device."

        "Abstract": "To attack the challenge of object identification and annotation across diverse families of image data, Prometheus and Raytheon will implement a software toolkit based on our new mathematically\u2013based AI tool. The AI input will be matrix coefficients resulting from the unique Prometheus-developed energy-spreading transform, PONS, the Prometheus Orthonormal Set. PONS is currently in use by both the US military, in the form of novel radar waveforms, and commercially by Cisco in their Intelligent Proximity technology. PONS applicability here and elsewhere results because the transform expresses high-resolution signals as sums of special low-resolution signals, where each low-resolution component is both a highly compressed version of the original signal and contains roughly the same amount of information as any other such component. This enables employment of these components as image snippets, thereby greatly reducing the raw data required by the AI engine. Existing real-world applications of PONS transforms, to wireless communications, optical communications, robust transmission of digital data, watermarking, and radar, all rely upon one-dimensional PONS transforms. We have extended the mathematical foundation by creating multidimensional PONS bases, deriving a new tensor decomposition theorem, and showing that the crucial energy spreading property carries over to multidimensional PONS. In the initial portion of this project we will extend the suite of one-dimensional PONS algorithms and FFT-like codes in order to utilize the mathematically proven and published two-dimensional PONS expansions. We will then apply our proven Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technologies to identify the same or similar objects in massive image data sets by employing one, or at most two, two-dimensional PONS matrix coefficients for each image."

LUCID fuses multiple data sources\/modalities (e.g., satellite imagery; content and volume data from social media and cell phones; trajectory and transportation flow data; etc.) to classify a large number of fine-grained LULC categories, while also detecting novel (e.g., non-traditional) land uses and proposing concomitant semantic labels to extend semantic coverage of the derived LULC classification. LUCID integrates five fundamental pillars that make feasible its performance goals: Automated extraction of modality-agnostic Semantic LULC Knowledge Graphs from all-source data (e.g., from satellite imagery, UAV video, unstructured text, and other sources); Automatic acquisition of semantic relations between fine-grained urban LULC classes and heterogeneous data sources\/modalities and delineation of their semantic hierarchy; Relational and Mutual Information Calculus to automate semantic enrichment of imagery data with complementary intelligence from other non-imagery sources\/modalities; Deep Sense-making models with Hierarchical Self-Attention and hybrid Neuro-Symbolic Machine Reasoning over Semantic Graphs for Fine-grained LULC classification; and Efficient training and low-effort human curation of cognitively-friendly, inter-operable AI\/ML\/DL pipelines to jointly automate flexible on-demand fusion of heterogeneous sensors\/modalities and facilitate fine-grained urban LULC classification."

        "Abstract": "The US Marine Corp has an existing critical capabilities gap\/requirement to equip medical logistics (MEDLOG) units with a Just-in-Time Medical Logistical Resupply System (JITMEDLOG) for medical resupply due to vulnerabilities revealed in fragile, remote systems that must be addressed to improve the reliability and robustness of these systems, e.g., Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS), Medical Common Operating Picture (MedCOP). Remote systems such as the latter and those made inaccessible by external events (e.g,. health emergencies, natural disaster, and wartime) must evolve into dynamic\/agile, reliable, and robust logistical support systems and networks. It is paramount to enhance the remote system\u2019s knowledge-of-self and dynamic data sharing and routing for current and future logistical needs. This is primarily due to long lead times on products, blood, and other supplies, causing a long delivery pathway. Significant unknowns in a contested environment with long range weapon capability also create the need for flexibility in communications and security. The current medical tracking process is comprised of paper filing and email; thus, the Marine Corps has a strong need to modernize and automate the process for supply tracking\/re-tracking, to include logistics of how to transport and when to order based on where an item of need is coming from for all reorders and resupplies. Remote Health Solutions, LLC (RHS) is an authorized distributor\/reseller of the Battlefield Assisted Trauma Distributed Observation Kit (BATDOK) and the worldwide Virtual Exam Room (VER) telemedicine video consult platform with real-time diagnostic patient data streaming. RHS has teamed with SIMBA Chain, Inc., experts in blockchain logistics and radio-frequency identification (RFID), (hereinafter, Team RHS) to offer the Marine Corps our real-time Resupply Internet of Things (IOT) (RIOT) ruggedized platform concept, complete with secure, tagged, and ratified data for JITMEDLOG analytics and medical supply tracking in order to enable patient care and decrease current pitfalls via modernization and automation. We propose a concept that is compatible with MHS Genesis to identify catalysts that either complement or replace existing delivery networks for worn, failed, or depleted parts and supplies. We will do this by providing RIOT analytics services based on assured data from device, human, and environmental sensors. This assured data can be used as a trustworthy foundation for employing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to support predictive analysis. We propose to leverage data, including environmental conditions such as training vs. theater, extreme conditions, humidity, temp, altitude, etc., to predict maintenance and supply chain requirements. Data will be protected, delineated, and secured using blockchain techn and will support a single source of truth for individual assets and enable data access restrictions relevant to individual roles."

The use of LPI\/LPD radar techniques in adversarial environments has become common in recent years.\u00a0 Many techniques and waveforms have been used, such as wide-bandwidth, frequency-agility, adaptive control of signal power, sidelobe reduction, binary phase codes, polyphase codes, Barker codes, Frank codes, and Polytime codes. \u00a0Many techniques are now used to counter LPI\/LPD operation, some of which rely on machine- and deep learning-based detection and localization algorithms.\u00a0 These can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of conventional LPI\/LPD radar techniques. Highly-adaptive, advanced, AI-based LPI\/LPD radar techniques need to be developed for the Navy to maintain operational advantage in near-peer conflicts.\u00a0 ARTEMIS proposes to develop and demonstrate multiple synergistic LPI\/LPD radar techniques that can quickly adapt in response to the tactical environment.\u00a0 We will leverage our LPI\/LPD waveform and AI \/ ML experience, developed through years of work on our current and past radar projects, including our next-generation SlimSDR radar system development (Army C5ISR Airborne Radar Branch, SBIR, Phase II Sequential and AFRL\/RWWI Phase II SBIR), to meet the requirement of this SBIR topic. In Phase I, ARTEMIS will create modeling and simulation (M&amp;S) tools for exploration of LPI\/LPD radar techniques.

ARTEMIS will also evaluate the computational requirements of the proposed solutions, as well as algorithm training requirements, as radar platforms vary greatly in processing capacity.\u00a0 The radar requirements will also be evaluated, as few radar systems are capable of operating in way that is compatible with highly adaptive LPI\/LPD techniques.\u00a0 Also, employing these concepts will have an impact on radar performance, ARTEMIS will quantify this impact and use it as one of the metrics for measuring the AI-based LPI\/LPD concepts.\u00a0 The SlimSDR will be used in Phase I as a stand-in radar to demonstrate the adaptive LPI\/LPD techniques."

        "Abstract": "US Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is increasingly reliant on technology to underpin critical operations integral to our national security and to compete against great powers on the technological field of battle. As adversaries, including peer competitors, invest and operationalize technology to degrade Special Operations Force\u2019s (SOF) mission performance, USSOCOM must make corresponding investments in technology that hyper-enable Special Operators. To do this, technology must be agnostic, flexible, and scalable to incorporate advances across a range of disciplines. The field of artificial intelligence (AI), and specifically machine learning, computer vision, and decision support systems, can greatly assist companies and organizations with human machine teaming (HMT), which is \u201cis a relationship - one made up of at least three equally important elements: the human, the machine, and the interactions and interdependencies between them.\u201d One of the most critical reasons to use HMT-related technologies is to offload cognitive load from a human operator or user onto the computer or technology. This allows the computer to quickly accomplish tasks better suited for it, such as AI-related tasks, repetitive and time-consuming tasks, or decision support. A decision support system (DSS) is a combination of many concepts addressed above. A DSS is a \u201cmodel-based set of procedures for processing data and judgments to assist decision makers to solve semi-structured and unstructured decision tasks.\u201d An AI-DSS is a DSS that makes use of AI techniques, such as expert systems, bayesian networks, fuzzy logic, and neural networks to allow processing of massive amounts of data available, making this information available as digestible knowledge for human decision makers to make better informed decisions at any level. An AI-DSS is critical because it offloads tasks previously being performed by humans to the AI-DSS, allowing the user\u2019s observe, orient, decide, and act (OODA) loop to cycle faster due to effective HMT pairing. It is increasingly difficult to both analyze and interpret vast amounts of data into a digestible, human-understandable format to enable decision making. Additionally, the current state of AI and Decision Support Systems makes it possible to offload some of this operator cognitive load onto machines to assist in the processing, analyzing, and display of relevant information and knowledge, allowing humans additional cognitive capacity to focus on other tasks requiring human attention. To achieve these goals, SOCOM seeks to develop a SOCOM AI Decision Assistance Robot (SAIDAR) that is a SOF-unique infrastructure, deployable on the range of platforms relevant to SOCOM - from simple, single-machine deployments on tactical devices and commodity hardware, all the way up to multi-machine, multi-tenant private or commercial cloud deployments - supporting a wide variety of decision support tasks throughout SOCOM."

        "Abstract": "Special Operations Forces (SOF) Operators face high cognitive loads while performing various mission threads, including making complicated decisions and maintaining situation awareness in a dynamic battlespace. This can involve managing equipment (sensors and effectors), maintaining awareness of the environment, developing courses of action (COAs) that comply with rules of engagement (ROEs), and executing those COAs. These tasks increase cognitive load for an operator or unit among all the other tasks they are performing during a mission. An Artificial Intelligence-based Decision Support System (AI-DSS) can help offload some or all of these tasks to help reduce warfighter cognitive load. In prior work, SoarTech and Black River Systems have together developed a TRL 6 AI-DSS called AssistMATE\u2122 and demonstrated the feasibility of delegating multiple tasks. Specifically, AssistMATE focused on reducing cognitive load for counter-sUAS missions, allowing the operator to offload tasks including generating of ROE-compliant courses of action that cover multiple potential sensors and effectors (i.e., counter-UAS platforms) and multiple potential targets. In other work, SoarTech has demonstrated AssistMATE capabilities in a variety of domains such as managing multiple UxVs simultaneously and helping users perform procedure-oriented tasks. In each application, the focus has been on reducing cognitive load on the operators through the application of artificial intelligence-based decision support tools. In this project, our team proposes to adapt and extend these capabilities to SOCOM use cases and needs, such as pivoting to on-the-move operations, to reduce operator cognitive load, increase situation awareness (SA), and accelerate decision making and response times for mission accomplishment."

        "Abstract": "To address the Strategic Capabilities Office\u2019s need for a high-throughput photonic processor for artificial intelligence\/machine learning programs, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes to develop a new Ultrafast Robust Optical Correlator (UROC) based on Intellisense\u2019s previously demonstrated Real-time Holographic Optical Correlator (RHOC) approach. The UROC system will build upon the demonstrated RHOC approach with a new high-throughput phase-only spatial light modulator (POSLM) design based on a state-of-the-art digital micromirror device (DMD) with temporal multiplexing using high-speed laser diode (LD) switching. The innovation in the use of a DMD-based POSLM design allows improvement in the correlator performance in terms of throughput with potentiality of =100k frames per second (fps) at =8k imagery resolution. Using the latest photonic technologies (LD, CMOS\/CCD sensors, FPGA electronics), UROC will be miniature in size, light weight, consume low power, and generate low heat. The digital nature of the DMD also allows on-chip binarization of input images without the need for prefiltering and provides a one-step interference process. In this direct-to-Phase II, Intellisense will improve upon the demonstrated RHOC architecture with a new DMD-based POSLM to design, develop the UROC prototype, demonstrate performance of &gt;2.5k fps and imagery with resolution &gt;2k pixels (&gt;20\u00d7 the 1990 capability), provide all required deliverables, produce studies addressing =100k fps throughput and =8k imagery resolution, and address counter-adversarial issues."

        "Abstract": "Cyber infrastructures efficiently supporting data collection and transmission have become essential to the mission of the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Intelligence is an extremely important element that impacts DoD\u2019s strategic decisions at critical times. The success f intelligence operations is possible only if quality data\/information\u2014and actionable insights from that data\u2014are securely, robustly, and efficiently collected in the field and transmitted back to DoD personnel. However, such information collection poses non-trivial technical challenges due to the fact that the recent advancements of network and artificial intelligence reinforce adversaries\u2019 capabilities of surveillance and disruption as a cyber threat. Stealth Software Technologies, Inc. (Stealth) proposes to develop a secure and private network data aggregation system that can carry out secure aggregate computation from two or more two or more data-collecting intelligence sources with practical efficiency and scalability. In addition, Stealth\u2019s proposed technology will be equipped with an auxiliary data exfiltration mechanism which only utilizes an out-of-band phone-to-phone ad-hoc network to transmit data while avoiding detection in case existing communication networks become compromised or unavailable. Our proposed technology will be developed upon cutting-edge cryptographic systems known as Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC). A MPC protocol is a distributed protocol that enables multiple distrusting servers with secret inputs to compute functions over the secret inputs so that the servers will learn only the output of the computation even if a subset of participating servers are compromised. Using our MPC protocols, we will develop a secure and robust midpoint consisting of a group of servers (e.g., 5 ~ servers) jointly carrying out secure filtering operations and aggregate computations over data uploaded by data collectors. The secure filtering protocol can down-select the intelligence data to a smaller, refined dataset according to conditions (e.g. expressed as keywords, thresholds, and so on) that can be controlled and set up by DoD personnel. In addition, DoD personnel will have control over what aggregate will be computed at the midpoint. Stealth will develop the platform, architecture, and tool chain necessary to integrate Stealth&apos;s innovative MPC technologies into the workflow of DoD\u2019s desired data midpoint operations, as well as the detection-avoiding exfiltration protocol. The intelligence data transmission and analysis will be modeled and prototyped as MPC computations with an MPC-friendly data format."

        "Abstract": "Hypersonic technologies are rapidly emerging into many defense platforms and are compounded by a congruent emergence of smart autonomy. In parallel, these technologies will allow for sophisticated high-speed maneuverable vehicles and missiles. As the United States maintains strategic advantages on these technologies, it is imperative that the U.S. also maintain superior counter technologies, including the ability to detect, track, classify, and extrapolate hypersonic targets of interest for early warning systems. Naturally, existing overhead persistent infrared (OPIR) sensors provide an excellent medium to apply state-of-the-art machine learning and\/or artificial intelligence technologies for hypersonics but there are a numerous challenges. First, conventional machine learning techniques rely on detailed image features for classification whereas OPIR sensors are far from earth and targets will appear small (e.g. 2 pixels) in images, thus lacking clearly defined static image features. This will require the adaptation of current machine learning techniques to pull classifications features from time dependent target kinematics and behaviors rather than relying on just a single image. Second, environmental background clutter conditions in the OPIR will vary wildly due to differences in the large terrain covered by the sensor as well as effects of clouds, glint, sensor noise, etc., yet performance characteristics must achieve a minimum baseline of consistency. Most importantly, however, is that all empirically trained parametric algorithms like neural networks require a representative training dataset to achieve performance. To address the emerging needs of hypersonic target and track in low earth orbital (LEO) OPIR systems, EpiSci\u2019s algorithm team has partnered with Raytheon Missile Systems\u2019 modeling and simulation team to propose AIded HyperTRACE, a modular tactical AI detection, classification, and predictive tracking system. The approach aims to use Raytheon\u2019s 15 years and more than $10M in high fidelity IR and sensor simulation development to produce representative training and evaluation datasets of hypersonic targets in complex environments and adverse conditions. The datasets will be used to train and replace conventional detection, classification and tracking modules with state-of-the-art modular neural network components efficiently and rapidly with multiple evaluation stages throughout program execution."

        "Abstract": "A current limitation of the use of forensic genetics, in particular kinship and phenotypic prediction, is the black box nature of many of the proprietary approaches currently in the market. Lynntech Inc. proposes a Phase II effort to develop Quick Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (Quick-SNP) as a DNA forensic genomics tool following the guidelines established by the President\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology for the Forensic Sciences (Lander, 2016). To establish the foundational validity that the techniques are scientifically sound, replicable, and accurate in a lab environment, and to ultimately demonstrate applied validity in real world applications. Quick-SNP analyzes na\u00efve DeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA) profiles, and in the process, establishes sample identities, predicts familial relationships (kinship and biogeographic ancestral), and ultimately will provide phenotypic profiles. Lynntech is developing Quick-SNP with a computational architecture that is efficient and capable of scaling to DNA profiles created by ever-increasing deep genomic sequencing techniques. Quick-SNP uses a large panel of SNPs (&gt;100k SNPs) and an Artificial Intelligence approach to reconstruct Identity-by-Descent (IBD) relationships in pedigree reconstructions, thus improving the statistical power and depth of estimates of kinship.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 For the Phase II efforts, Lynntech will focus on iterative improvement to the approach developed during Phase I.\u00a0 Lynntech will mature the computational architecture by improving the performance as compared to the preliminary architecture evaluated as part of the Phase I effort.

        "Abstract": "We propose to develop a system that can automatically detect marine mammals day and night for extended periods of time using infrared video cameras and custom software. We plan to make use of commercial long wave infrared (LWIR) cameras. For vessel\u2010based data collections we will use a custom camera developed by Toyon that stabilizes imagery electronically using data from a low\u2010cost inertial navigation system (INS). Stabilized video from multiple imagers will be sent to a detector where human\u2010 designed algorithms will be used to find potential locations of marine mammals. Video will be clipped spatially and temporally around each detection and the resulting video clip will be sent to a deep neural network classifier that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to classify the video clips. Further development of the AI module will be the primary focus of this effort and this will entail the collection and formatting of large volumes of data as well as the evaluation of multiple architecture models to determine the best for this application. A fully functioning real\u2010time system will be created and demonstrated to NOAA staff as well as potential Phase III partners"

Sherlock, as a generic tool, already provides an integrated workspace for performing typical data analysis in an intuitive and efficient way, data exploration tools for viewing connections between datasets of any type (provided they are presented to the app in database form), and will soon incorporate the ability for users to create custom tools and machine learning models. The Sherlock engine will run within each app in the suite, extending to provide automatic population of pre-defined or user-defined metrics dashboards along each step of the missile lifecycle, clustering and filtering tools to reduce the complexity and quantity of information presented to the user, the ability to explore, add, and edit data connections, and the capability to allow users to add novel machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) tools directly into the app. Since Sherlock is generic in nature, it can be integrated with any type of data, and will be tailored to each application it supports, as well as remain a standalone tool for generic data analysis.

        "Abstract": "A simulation optimization tool can exploit existing missile defense simulation models to streamline the scenario generation analysis process. OptTek&apos;s Phase I project will focus on using a simulation optimization approach to solve the problem of generating a minimal collection of test scenarios, using the minimum number of shared scenario components, that meets a required set of test objectives. Each individual scenario taken through the end to end scenario generation process involves substantial effort including discussion, documentation, and manual scenario generation in high fidelity tools. Likewise, scenario components require a great deal of time and effort to prepare for the test event. We will explore the use of an optimization tool with medium fidelity digital simulation models early in the scenario generation process to minimize the required test scenarios and scenario components. OptTek proposes to enhance previously created scenario generation optimizer software, updating it to work with the current software. Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI) \/machine learning (ML) predictors will be created and trained to automatically suggest independent combinations of test objectives in scenarios that will be used to make the scenario generation process more efficient. Finally, to support digital test and assessment, mechanisms for adaptive management of digital tests will be explored that will reduce the number of simulation runs needed to achieve desired assessment results.

The ScOPE solution will take test objectives and stakeholder requirements like the Scenario Planning Matrix and produce an optimized list of scenarios and data attributes and provide a visual verification and tailoring function in the form of an intermediate 3D graphical representation of generated scenarios. The resulting output in the form of scenarios that have been mapped across test objectives are then available to be included in the event Test Case Description Document (TCDD) that is provided to event participants for use to develop and integrate the required models that support the overall digital test infrastructure. AI\/ML Deep Learning: Generating credible scenarios for missile defense is a complex problem that requires significant computing resources, data, and expert knowledge. Supervised Deep Learning provides a mechanism by using an artificial neural network where neurons and strengthening of pathways are modeled after the human brain to progressively learn what a credible scenario looks like. The resulting neural network with its embedded expert knowledge can then accurately \u201cpredict\u201d previously unidentified credible scenarios given new input scenario requirements. The core aspects of the ScOPE optimization process that shorten scenario planning times are the Test Matrix Optimizer and the AI\/ML-powered Expert Scenario Generator. The Test Matrix Optimizer leverages well-known Combinatorial Optimization techniques suited to solving similar problems. Approved for Public Release | 21-MDA-11013 (19 Nov 21)"

        "Abstract": "The main objective of this Phase I project is to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a unified geometry service to support multiple engineering disciplines within missile defense core truth Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S). The project will leverage innovation from the tactical missile sector into the strategic missile sector and apply it to three core practices: 1. CAD-precise modeling of product geometry and selection of the constituent physical materials; 2. Encapsulation, configuration, and execution of engineering discipline models, along with the marshaling of associated data products; 3. Abstraction of engineering models behind an integrated user interface. The unified geometry service will become a key enabler for modeling future interceptors and threat missiles. In the adjacent sector of tactical missiles, this innovation has been proven to scale across disciplines and even materiel product lines, increase both the quality and speed of engineering data, achieve faster design analysis cycles, increase actionable engineering insight, and produce substantial life-cycle cost avoidance. The Phase I product will be scalable toward additional core truth engineering disciplines in Phase II, and toward Digital Engineering and artificial intelligence (AI) \/ machine learning (ML) in Phase III.

        "Abstract": "System-wide battle management handles tasking and assignments to sensors and weapon systems, each weapon system then assigns weapons from its inventory and requests tasking. Mixed field inventory assignment and management can be difficult to optimize in light of fundamental uncertainties. Not only does salvo composition need to be constructed from more than one weapon system, but significant differences in ability and reliability of the various interceptors must also be considered. Additionally, salvo timing and management after launch in light of potential battle space updates should inform the battle management. Using threat state from the centralized battle manager, and considerations concerning the type of threat system being engaged in terms of fundamental capabilities \u2013 matching interceptor capabilities to threat capabilities provides technical merit. Considering fixed inventory sizes, and uncertain threat inventories, we define how highly capable and reliable weapons should be partitioned to address the threat. Salvo composition, timing and management, before as well as after launch is optimized with respect to available, and dynamic, threat information. We propose a solution that optimizes pre- and post-launch dynamic salvo assignment and re-assignment of mixed field inventory with innovative Artificial Intelligence that manages inventory across the battled and achieved required Pkill against diverse raid threats in the presence of multiple uncertainties.

The decision aid system provides functionality for an operator-configurable offline (pre-mission) Monte-Carlo simulation across huge numbers of scenario permutations, in order to train the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm components. RLISM provides an operator-configurable simulation and user interface to model, test, assess, and train operators with the RLISM online capabilities. Incorporated within RLISM is a pre-launch constraint satisfaction combinatorial solver, and associated user interface, to optimize, plan, and assess interceptor salvo compositions, configurations, and schedule timing. To incorporate in-flight updates, a mission management capability, and associated user interface, is provided for reactive engagement re-tasking in real time. The algorithmic basis to accomplish the above will combine algorithms for combinatorial optimization and reinforcement learning, to leverage the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d \u2013 the deterministic constraint handling of combinatorial optimization, with the speed and flexibility of RL.

In Phase I, Toyon will employ a simulator that models launch and flight of interceptors, missile launch and exo-atmospheric deployment of objects, and, finally, the success of any engagement. Existing battle simulator assets will be leveraged to develop the proof-of-concept simulator. Once available, the simulator will be packaged into a new training environment for use in Toyon\u2019s Modular Autonomy Incubator (MAUI), a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework. Agents will be trained using adversarial multi-agent self-play. This state-of-the-art technique allows each agent to both learn and master complicated tasks from the experience gained while competing in a simulated environment. In Phase II, the simulation environment will be enhanced to support higher-fidelity models and increased functionality. Using the enhanced simulator, agents will be further trained over millions of simulated mission sets using Toyon\u2019s MAUI framework and high-performance computing cluster.

        "Abstract": "Additive manufacturing is a rapidly growing fabrication process due to its versatility and fast manufacturing capability. Additively manufactured (AM) metal parts often contain voids and intra-granular impurities which reduce the performance of the part in terms of strength and durability. These defects are often difficult to detect in the finished part. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a non-destructive method to not only detect and quantify these defects, but also to correlate the results to the expected strength and fatigue life of the part. To accomplish this, we will utilize complementary non-destructive evaluation (NDE) modalities that can rapidly identify regions with defects in AM parts and scan the regions of interest (ROIs) with high resolution. Mechanical properties of AM parts will be evaluated and these data will be used to train the machine learning algorithms to build artificial intelligence (AI) into the system. The Phase I program has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our novel approach, and the Phase II program is aimed at developing a TRL 5 system which can then be translated into commercial space.

        "Abstract": "Connecting data silos and extracting information is a ubiquitous challenge for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA). MDA operates many subsystems from diverse suppliers built with multi-generation technology. These subsystems emit complex and wide-ranging data flows at petabyte scale that makes data conversion impractical. There is a desire for unified data access for analysis, and for Artificial Intelligence (AI) Machine Learning (ML) model development and insight. Impediments to these mission needs are constantly evolving data interfaces, diverse data formats, the need to move and analyze petabyte-scale-data, and difficulty in accessing data. The proposed approach automatically extracts meta-data from subsystems to dynamically link evolving data into a common data repository or \u201cData Lake\u201d for routine and impromptu analysis. Metadata enables a process that maximizes performance by limiting data manipulation, and ensures integrity by keeping data in its original form. Metadata is used to create views into the repository so that the pools of heterogenous data appear homogeneous to a diverse analysis community and their custom and commercial tools.

STILMAN has developed an XAI-based dynamic kill chain planning and preview capability. Unlike many other Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches, this LG-based XAI analysis is fast, flexible, scalable, and explainable \u2013 and it applies to multi-mission, multi-domain and multi-tier sensor and weapon platforms. Dynamic, \u201ci.e., reactive\u201d resource allocation recommendations are displayed via 2D or 3D animations. The animations and quantitative metrics provide the human commander with an on-the-loop visualization that prioritizes resource allocations in faster than real-time.

        "Abstract": "Monitoring modern-day fisheries is extremely challenging. Every day, millions of vessels harvest the\noceans, and many remain unregulated, putting target and non-target fish populations at risk of\noverexploitation and collapse. To combat this, fisheries managers are increasingly turning to Electronic\nMonitoring (EM) technologies \u2013 integrated systems of cameras and sensors \u2013 to record onboard activity\nand gather the large amounts of data required to make sound regulatory decisions.\nFisheries managers require advanced data analysis tools to handle the surplus of data produced by these systems. A single commercial fishing trip can produce over 1000 hours of video, which must be manually reviewed on-land to quantify all fishing activities, including fish that are caught and discarded, and encounters with protected species. Due to the substantial time required for processing, without significant technological advancements these technologies are forecast to cover only 1.5% of the world\u2019s fishing activity by 2030.\nThis project will build upon recent research in artificial intelligence and computer vision to automate\nfisheries data processing, making EM technologies viable for widespread adoption. Specifically, Ai.Fish\nwill prototype a specialized computer vision system for counting and classifying fish onboard commercial fishing vessels using video and sensor data from EM systems."

Using BIO, an ophthalmologist can determine the presence of multiple retinal diseases such as diabetic\nretinopathy, macular degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity, among others. The traditional BIO exam\ndoes not produce any visual documentation.\nEyeStar-BIO will feature innovative features that are not currently offered as part of digital BIO exams: (1)\nautomatic image quality assessment, (2) automatic stitching to create a wide-field view of the retina, (3)\nlongitudinal analysis, and (4) AI-based disease detection. This project has an $800M market potential as BIO\nexaminations remain one of the most common procedures for ophthalmologists.\nThe goals of this Phase I project will be accomplished via three specific aims. Aim 1: implement software for\nautomatic image quality assessment of digital BIO video frames. Aim 2: develop image stitching methods to\ngenerate a wide field view of the retina using the best quality frames in the video. Aim 3: generate images to\ntrack differences in time due to disease progression or regression.\nThe EyeStar-BIO software will be licensed to manufacturers of digital BIO headsets. Future developments will\ninclude real time implementations of EyeStar-BIO and the ability to diagnose retinal disease using artificial\nintelligence."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\nIDOC Software proposes the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, together with user-friendly\nsoftware, for facilitating the efficient production of Systematic Reviews (SRs) in the field of Environmental\nHealth (EH). SR is the \u201cGold Standard\u201d for assessing evidence to be used for decision making in a variety of\nhealth contexts, including health care, public health and environmental health.\nSRs synthesize evidence from studies that meet eligibility criteria based on the decision being made (such as\nhazard identification or risk assessment). All relevant studies need to be considered in an SR, meaning that all\nof the potentially related articles must be evaluated one by one. For example, if the SR question relates only to\n40-65 year old women, then studies containing men or containing women outside this age range must be\nexcluded from the final set of articles used to draw a conclusion. The time (and expense) involved in screening\npotentially thousands of citations is substantial, often taking a team of screeners months to complete. This\nseverely limits the numbers of SRs that can be conducted and threatens timely decisions by policy makers.\nAI has tremendous potential to accelerate the conduct of SRs by automatically recognizing words that relate to\neligibility criteria, however there are significant challenges. In the field of EH the same study populations,\nexposures, and health outcomes can be described with many different combinations of words and phrases. It\nis difficult for AI algorithms to generalize language in the way needed to overcome the complexity inherent in\nthese scientific communications.\nIDOC Software has developed algorithms capable of deducing connections between words and phrases.\nThese learned connections are formed around a EH framework, or ontology, known as PECO: Population,\nExposure, Comparator, and Outcome. The software maps key words and phrases in an article onto these\ncategories and then highlights these terms in the article text via color-coding. A screener then need not read an\nentire article to determine if it meets the eligibility criteria. Instead, the screener scans the \u201cP\u201d colored words to\ndetermine if the population studied meets the \u201cP\u201d inclusion criteria. Then the \u201cE\u201d colored words can be\nevaluated, and so on. This accelerates the rate at which a screener can evaluate articles manyfold.\nThe challenge for the AI algorithms is to then find all the PECO words and phrases and accurately categorize\nthem. High accuracy requires taking into account causal and other relationships between the words and\nphrases. Advances in machine learning and natural language processing achieved in Phase I on article titles\nand abstracts, and then on the full text of articles in Phase II, will result in more efficient conduct of SRs,\nreducing costs and time, and thereby furthering the goal of making timely evidence-informed decisions and\npolicy to protect public health from unsafe environmental exposures."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nHemophilia, A, B, C, and vwF are inherited bleeding disorders resulting from a partial or complete deficiency of\nFactor VIII (FVIII) or Factor IX (FIX), respectively. Factor-based therapies involve the administration of\nexogenous clotting factor concentrates with the aim of achieving the necessary levels of circulating protein.\nHowever, factor-based therapies present the complication of inhibitors (antibodies) inactivating the therapeutic\nagents, rendering treatments ineffective. Current investigational therapies seek to diminish the anti-clotting\nnatural control factors Protein C, Anti-thrombin and Tissue Factor Protein Inhibitor (TFPI-inhibitor) in order to\nenhance clotting in patients with impaired clotting. This approach has significant challenges since the coagulation\nprocess must remain extremely well-balanced and is important to make sure that prevention of hemorrhage by\nenhancing clotting does not result in inadvertent thrombosis. Furthermore, most of these therapies are\nadministered in bi-weekly injections, subcutaneous or intravenous, and adverse events relating to injectables\nremain a concern.\nOur overarching goal was to understand the remarkable effects of traditionally used plant extracts on wound\nhealing and the balance between hemostasis and thrombosis, and their application in developing an oral\ntreatment for hemophilia. YewSavin\u2019s plant-derived pair of coagulant and anti-coagulant molecules result in the\nbest balance of hemostasis and thrombosis. This small molecule oral, the first in such class, treatment\nstrategy, two Complementary Components (CC_2), consisting of Chalcones (pro-coagulant) and Flavones (anti-\ncoagulant), that could potentially revolutionize hemophilia and anti-thrombotic treatments for clotting and\nthrombotic disorders alike by promoting blood clotting processes without causing thrombosis.\nIn preliminary studies, bio-assays of clotting and healing times guided our initial fractionation assays towards\nidentifying single molecule entities that promoted clotting and healing. We triangulated molecules for hemophilia\ntreatment and accelerated healing using our proprietary artificial intelligence (AI), structure match (SAR), and\nexperimental verification by bioassay guided fractionation ability. Using a Factor VIII knockout (KO) mouse\nmodel, we demonstrated that our identified CC_2 molecules cause significant improvement in clotting time, in\nnormal rats and in Factor VIII KO mice. These results demonstrate that CC_2 is not Factor VIII dependent and\nis also more efficient than the first line therapy currently used, injection of Factor VIII. Finally, there are currently\nno known anti-thrombin small molecule agents. According to our preliminary results, the mechanism of action\nseems to be the dose-dependent reversal of the Heparin-Antithrombin complex that blocks coagulation.\nThis project proposed by YewSavin, Inc. will apply knowledge of clotting processes gained from plant\nmolecules to address the challenges of hemostasis-thrombosis balanced therapy and to advance discovery of a\nclass of small molecule, non-immunogenic, compounds for oral prophylactic treatment in hemophilia."

In this work, Optiva Fertility aims to develop a novel embryo assessment\nbased on metabolic imaging using Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) in conjunction with\nartificial intelligence (AI) techniques. To date, Optiva Fertility has designed, tested, and deployed\na first generation metabolic imaging system and has commenced clinical work.\nBringing this technology to the point where it provides significant benefit to IVF patients requires\na multi-stage development and verification process which forms the basis for the proposed work\nin this grant. Based on the results from an observational pilot trial, Optiva will design a large\nscale, multi-site observational trial. The purpose of this study is to obtain a dataset large enough\nto train robust AI models for assessing embryo viability. Facilitating this trial will require\nengineering and constructing a second generation metabolic imaging system featuring a more\ncompact and integrated hardware design, automated calibration, upgraded controls software,\nand enhanced imaging technology. It is anticipated that this system will be very similar to the\neventual commercial product. Successful completion of this work will further the understanding\nof the role metabolism plays in embryo viability, as well as leave Optiva well positioned to\nundertake a pivotal interventional trial."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\nIn this project, we will leverage two artificial intelligence (AI) tools and our company\u2019s unique Historeceptomics\napproach to rapidly discover an impactful new drug candidate to treat opioid use disorder (OUD) relapse via\ninhibition of withdrawal-associated negative affect (hyperkatifeia). The premise is that, unlike traditional drug\ndiscovery, which is conceptualized starting from drug targets (e.g., mu opioid receptor) and proceeds to\nphenotypes (e.g., pain relief), we can select specific cells or tissues that control a specific in vivo phenotype, in\nthis case hyperkatifeia, and work backward to identify a drug target specific for those cells, followed by the\ndiscovery of a drug-like compound that modulates that drug target. This would be a revolutionary new\nparadigm for OUD drug discovery, translating extensive neuroscience knowledge about neural circuits that\nelicit specific analgesic, addiction or withdrawal phenotypes directly into drugs, which has not been direct or\nefficient before. The critical technical advance that makes this paradigm possible is the capability to screen\nvirtually for drug candidates targeted at any human gene product. In other words, this drug discovery process\ncan start agnostic to the eventual target, with confidence that ligands for that target can rapidly be discovered\nonce it is identified. This advance is made possible by our Historeceptomics technologies, which allow us to\nquery a specific cell or tissue and identify, with statistical significance, gene products exclusive or maximally\nspecific to that tissue. The advance is also made temporally feasible by two historic breakthroughs in AI: 1)\nAlphaFold2 from DeepMind\/Google, which has predicted accurate 3D structures, suitable for virtual chemical\nlibrary screening, for every human gene product for the first time in history; and 2) breakthrough AI binding\naffinity prediction for drug candidates to 3D structures developed by our partner Molsoft LLC, which uses a\nconvolutional neural network. We thus aim to 1) adapt our current Historeceptomics Tissue Search software\nfeature to single cell RNA seq data profiling of the human amygdala and identify gene products exclusive to\nRspo2+ neurons, which control hyperkatifeia. 2) perform an ultra-large virtual library screen using our AI\nbinding affinity prediction of the 1.5 billion Enamine Real database of drug-like chemical compounds for drug\ncandidates that bind to the AlphaFold2-generated, manually optimized, 3D structure of the thus-identified gene\nproduct, 3) test validated hit compounds for their ability to reduce the negative affect of protracted opioid\nabstinence and relapse in vivo. A drug targeting reinstatement in people suffering from OUD is arguably more\nimpactful than other anti-addiction approaches, because it could synergize with medication-assisted treatment\n(MAT), psychosocial therapies and community-based recovery supports by neurochemically reducing the\nimpact of triggers conditioned by avoidance of withdrawal symptoms. We will leverage AI to discover such a\ndrug within three years with modest investment, which would both advertise the paradigm of tissue\/cell focused\ndrug discovery and the power of AI to accelerate drug discovery for OUD\/SUD."

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nRates of stimulant use, both illicit (e.g. methamphetamine and cocaine) and prescription (e.g.\nAdderall) are surging on the heels of the opioid epidemic, worsened by the isolation associated\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike opioid use disorder, there are currently no FDA-approved\nmedications for the treatment of stimulant use disorder (StUD), leaving only abstinence support\nand behavioral modification therapies. These are costly treatments with poor efficacy, as\nevidenced by the high rate of relapse (60-90%). Stimulant use disorder is clearly an unmet need.\nVeriSIM Life is an innovative company developing and utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and\nmachine learning (ML) technologies for faster drug discovery and development. Our patented\nBIOiSIM platform enables prediction of small molecule pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics\nvia an AI\/ML-parameterized whole-body physiologically based modelling. It is designed to\naccurately predict the clinical value of investigational drugs before human trials. The full-stack AI-\nenabled bio-simulation models significantly reduce the number of animal tests required for\nadvancing therapeutics through the pipeline, accelerating drug development and markedly\nincreasing return on investment. The primary goal of this SBIR application is to develop, validate\nand utilize a reliable and accurate AI-driven tool incorporated with the core BIOiSIM platform to\naccelerate discovery and development of pharmaceuticals intended for the mitigation of StUD.\nThe current Phase I proposal will begin to address this goal through two complementary\napproaches. Development of the AI-driven pharmacokinetic modeling specific to CNS drug\ndistribution with the following screening of virtual compound libraries will be performed in Aim 1.\nThis will be supported by proof-of-concept validation of a subset of compounds with in vivo\npharmacokinetics. Aim 2 will focus on development of pharmacodynamics prediction modeling\nfor stimulant use disorder drug discovery and development. The focus will be on potential\ntherapeutic targets that modulate neuronal plasticity, identified through an in-depth analysis of the\npreclinical and clinical literature. This will be supported by proof-of-concept validation of a subset\nof compounds with preclinical intravenous self-administration studies using cocaine and\nmethamphetamine. The proposed AI\/ML-driven approach is expected to markedly accelerate the\ndevelopment process for new stimulant use disorder medications by directing efforts to\ncompounds with optimal ADME and pharmacodynamic properties. Such an approach will create\nan avenue for fast-track development of affordable and efficacious therapeutics for StUD among\nother indications."

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\/ABSTRACT\nCompared to urban residents, rural communities have higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD) with worse disease control, resulting in higher rates of morbidity and mortality. In general, rural residents\nsuffer from higher poverty and uninsured rates, further compounded by geographic isolation and limited access\nto quality healthcare. This and other social factors have resulted in higher incidence and worse outcomes of\nnearly every chronic disease. Telehealth holds promise to address these challenges and expand access to\nspecialist care in these communities, but qualitative telehealth visits often lack necessary patient data for\nphysicians to make informed management decisions. Telemedicine is also often hindered by limited broadband\naccess in rural areas. Wearable technologies for remote monitoring suffer similar limitations, and, due to cost\nand burdensome daily engagement requirements, lead to poor adherence rates in an older, sicker population.\nTo address these challenges, Medentum is developing an affordable and accessible, multi-functional, home-use\ndevice featuring a camera, low-cost sensors (temperature, pulse oximeter) and a digital stethoscope. A\ncompanion phone application allows the recording of demographics, sociocultural data, medical history, and\nsymptoms, and guides the patient to collect their biometric readings with the handheld device. Without the\nnecessity of broadband, the patient can transmit their information securely to a remote physician\/chronic disease\nspecialist who can make a diagnosis and treatment plan. For this SBIR, Medentum will adapt its device and\nsoftware platform for respiratory disease, layering it with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, to create a digital\nrespiratory disease framework (DRDF) that empowers self-management of COPD. The aims of this SBIR are to\n1) study the usability and feasibility of this COPD respiratory framework in a rural Central Appalachian population\nof 75 patients in Southwest Virginia and 2) build preliminary AI algorithms that autonomously predict COPD\nexacerbation risk by analyzing low burden variables including risk factors (social, behavioral, environmental),\nsymptoms, COPD Assessment tests, and device biometrics (temperature, pulse, oxygen saturation, respiration\nrate and breath sounds). In Phase II, the platform will incorporate smart triggers that will alert patients if certain\nenvironmental risk factors are met, prompting them to engage with the platform. The smart algorithms will then\nautomatically predict their COPD exacerbation risk, ultimately triaging them to appropriate treatment. Predicting\nand pre-empting disease exacerbation by facilitating early connections to medical providers for prompt and\neffective treatment will have an enormous impact on health outcomes and treatment costs for rural COPD\npatients. Ultimately, this platform will augment COPD self-management, promote preventive respiratory care,\nand disseminate evidence-based COPD treatments, all designed to reduce the significant health disparities in a\nremote, underserved Central Appalachian population with worse respiratory outcomes."

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nFailure to achieve tight glucose control in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is a major cause of morbidity and\nmortality. The current method for controlling glucose for the almost 6 million patients admitted to the ICU each\nyear consists of time-intensive, error-prone, manual processes in which nurses have to check patient glucose\nlevels, calculate dosing and rates for intravenous (IV) insulin, and adjust IV pumps. These steps can decrease\nnursing efficiency by up to 2 hours per patient per day.\nIdeal Medical Technologies is developing an improved system for glucose control in ICU patients. FUSIONTM,\nour closed-loop glucose control system, acts as an artificial pancreas; our innovation centers on using biomimicry\nto design our artificial intelligence-based algorithms so that they function like the glucose regulation system\nnatively present in humans. These algorithms allow FUSION to continuously monitor a patient\u2019s blood glucose\nlevel and autonomously infuse insulin and\/or dextrose into the patient to maintain the blood glucose level within\na physician-prescribed range. An automated, closed-loop approach to regulating glucose in critically ill patients\nwould represent a paradigm shift in treatment protocols, and ultimately, morbidity and mortality rates in the ICU.\nOne potential additional benefit of a closed-loop glucose control system beyond improved patient outcomes is\nthe possibility of decreasing nursing time spent on glucose control.\nThe FDA designated FUSION as a Breakthrough Medical Device in 2019, and our original IDE application was\napproved by the FDA as of this year. In this proposed project, we intend to optimize a commercial FUSION\nsystem and test it first in a 10-person non-randomized clinical safety trial and then in a 30-person randomized\ncontrolled safety and efficacy trial \u2013 both trials will be performed in an ICU at Emory University.\nSuccessful completion of this project will demonstrate clinical safety and preliminary efficacy of the FUSION\nclosed-loop glucose control system and will enable us to then move into larger efficacy Phase III trials in a\nsubsequent stage of development and commercialization; these Phase III trials will complete our data package\nfor the FDA for marketing approval."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nOutcomes in pediatric liver transplantation (pLT) are not limited by the donated organ supply. Kids are dying\nwaiting for organs even when these deaths are completely preventable through proper organ selection. Instead of\ndying, children can live a full and active lifetime with a properly selected liver graft for transplant. Critical to\nachieving zero waitlist mortality and long-term transplant benefit is the capacity to intervene in a timely manner\nwith a suitable organ and graft type. Decisions to proceed with pLT are complicated, ultimately based on the\nalignment of transplant team experience, clinical assessment, and organ availability. In an era of organ shortages,\nthe use of technical variant (TV) grafts, including split liver transplantation and living donor liver transplant, has\nthe potential to expand graft choice and enable timelier surgical intervention. Most transplant programs that have\nprior experience with TV grafts have low patient mortality and excellent transplant outcomes. However, some\ntransplant programs that have limited prior experience with TV grafts have reported many poor outcomes for\npatients receiving TV transplants. Despite improvements in overall outcomes, national registry data have\nconfirmed significant variation among transplant centers in waitlist mortality, TV graft use, and post-transplant\noutcomes. Integrally linked to this variation is the intricacy of transplant decision making. Collectively, donor\nand graft acceptance, prioritization of candidates, and allocation policies depict a complex scenario. More than\n100 variables can be considered in a single donor-recipient \u2018\u2018best matching\u2019\u2019 decision, with a risk of subjectivity\nand mismatch because of human limitations that should not be underestimated. Recognizing these limitations,\nartificial intelligence classifiers, including machine learning and deep learning, have been recognized for their\npotential to support or confirm decision making within the field of transplantation. Still, overall data-driven\nsupport for optimal graft selection and dissemination of graft decision support is lacking. Opportunities for, and\nthe impact of, discovery are high. This project will result in a composite decision support software tool that uses\nmachine learning to predict and model the best survival for the patient using pre-transplant mortality, post-\ntransplant outcomes, and prior center experience. The decision support tool can be established to supplement\ncurrent graft selection practices in pLT. We anticipate that modeling based on composite measures will\ndemonstrate equivalent outcomes in recipients of TV grafts. We will develop an algorithm for optimal pediatric\ngraft-type selection that will be commercialized for use through the Starzl Network for Excellence in Pediatric\nTransplantation and after further multi-center validation it will be available for all pediatric transplant programs.\nWe will accomplish our objective through the following three aims. One, determine the optimal feature space for\npredictive variables for patient and pLT graft survival. Two, develop survival prediction models, \u201cPSELECT,\u201d for\nremaining on the waitlist or receiving various graft types. Three, demonstrate the simulated technical feasibility\nto eliminate the waitlist mortality based on the PSELECT performance on previously held-out data."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\/AbstractSince the birth of biotechnology in the 1980s, efficient nucleic acid synthesis has been a key\ndriver of biological discovery and bio-product development, culminating in the recent emergence of\nthe \u2018synthetic biology\u2019 field and rapid development of nucleic acid therapeutics. Sequence-specific\nRNA and DNA manufacturing is having an especially strong impact in healthcare, where FDA\napproval of the first oligonucleotide-based therapeutics in 2018 quickly led to many hundreds of\nsimilar drugs entering clinical trials. Despite these positive developments, new DNA and RNA\nsynthesis technologies are urgently needed to meet the rapidly rising demand for clinical-grade\noligonucleotides, because the current chemical synthesis strategies are costly, difficult to scale,\ninefficient and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length. In the past decade, enzymatic\noligonucleotide synthesis (EOS) strategies have been explored and developed for this purpose.In a Phase I feasibility project, Primordial Genetics Inc. demonstrated the use of novel template-\nindependent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of natural, unmodified nucleotides to\na growing DNA strand in a simple process that does not require a chemical deblocking step. This\ninnovation has the potential to enable a robust, inexpensive, flexible, environmentally friendly and\neasily scalable enzymatic route to manufacturing DNA and RNA used in therapeutics, vaccines,\ndiagnostics and RandD products.In this Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics\nproposes to continue the Phase I work to optimize the already discovered TIDPs to enable a high\nrate (99%) of single nucleotide addition in each synthesis cycle that is needed for an industrial EOS\nprocess. The company\u2019s genetic improvement and screening platform, specifically the Function\nGenerator\u2122 technology, will be applied together with the artificial intelligence and machine learning\ncapabilities of our computational biology collaborator Koliber Biosciences to improve these enzymes\nto the desired level of efficiency. A prototype EOS process will be developed using the optimized\nenzymes acting on oligonucleotides immobilized on a solid support.The prototype EOS process has the potential to enable more efficient DNA and RNA synthesis\nand remove the manufacturing bottlenecks that are currently holding back the development of nucleic\nacid medicines. Over time, we will adapt the TIDPs to allow synthesis of all modified nucleotides\ncurrently being incorporated into DNA- and RNA-based therapeutics, vaccines, as well as reagents\nfor diagnostics, RandD and DNA-based information storage."

        "Abstract": "Dementia and other age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) and Alzheimer\u2019s\nDisease Related Dementias (ADRD) cause a marked decrease in quality of life for patients, an increased burden\nof care, and, for adults over 65, are a leading cause of death. Therefore, better understanding of the nature of\ndementia is vital to the development and assessment of effective treatment options. Despite the grim lookout,\nclinical research suggests that intervening the disease before irreversible brain damage occurs is a key step to\nimprove the outcomes of AD\/ADRD. Specifically, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the stage before the onset of\ndementia, could provide the largest \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d for lifestyle interventions that can delay\/prevent MCI\nand dementia. Our team has reported lifestyle changes which brings a window of opportunity for the disease\ntreatment prior to irreversible brain damages.Several studies have demonstrated a relationship between MCI and driving performance including driving\nbehaviors. Although driving features provide an unobstructive window of opportunity to test the brain\nresponses under everyday cognitive challenges, it is currently unrealistically costly and labor-intensive to be\nwidely deployed. We hypothesize an unobstructive, continuous, economical system capable of assessing\ndriving signatures that can detect early stages of neurodegenerative diseases would offer a window to reverse\nAD and ADRD. In this work, we propose to develop and validate an unobtrusive and car-make agnostic\nsensing system, named Smart Pad, for daily assessment of driving indicators under free-living conditions. The\nsystem: 1) automatically records and analyzes data with the integrated biosensor array and a mobile App to\nevaluate driving; 2) uses the biosensors array to detect not only driving habits, but also new driving\nperformance indicators and unprecedented driver\u2019s biomarker (posture and metabolic rate), which are\ncorrelated with detrimental cognitive stages, and 3) is empowered by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm to\npredict cognitive performance and MCI. In this Phase I proposal, we will leverage the Smart Pad prototype\ndesign that we have developed and optimize it to for the diagnosis of driver\u2019s cognitive status.\nThe TF Health Co.-ASU-BNI team will work together to build the unobtrusive, vehicle-based sensing\nsystem for daily assessment of driver performance and biometrics, and age-related cognitive decline to\ndevelop new technology for early diagnosis of dementia in free-living condition, seeking to improve patient care\noptions and promote cognitive decline prevention interventions."

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY\nIn 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for action towards achieving the global elimination of\ncervical cancer. Member states ratified a strategy for achieving this goal in August 2020. The WHO plan calls\nfor an aggressive approach of vaccination, screening, and treatment of the human papillomavirus (HPV), the\nsingle cause of cervical cancer. In low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), which bear 90% of the incidence\nand mortality of cervical cancer globally, it is estimated that these goals will not be reached until 2120 \u2013 a\ncentury from now. One way to shorten this timeline is through HPV self-sampling and immediate treatment for\nthose at the highest risk of developing invasive disease. This will only be possible through a\nlow-cost and effective test that is easy to use in the field, combined with triage strategies that channel women\nto treatment but avoid unnecessary procedures that drain limited resources. The modified AmpFire\u00ae HPV\nGenotyping test (Atila Biosystems, CA) is a new test that identifies 13 high-risk HPV types and stratifies them\nby oncogenic risk into four groups. AmpFire\u00ae relies on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) rather\nthan DNA extraction, thus allowing for small-batch processing in 1-2 hours at a low cost per sample. No other\nHPV test has these characteristics, which allow for the development of same-day screen-and-treat strategies\nthat can triage women at the highest risk, reduce loss to follow-up, and decrease overtreatment. Furthermore,\nthe modified AmpFire\u00ae has demonstrated high sensitivity in self-collected samples. The purpose of this study is\nto evaluate the performance of this in the detection of high-grade precancer (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,\ngrade 2 or higher, or CIN2+). We will also pilot a same-day screen-and-treat strategy using AmpFire\u00ae and\nAutomated Visual Assessment (AVE), an artificial intelligence triage method based on an assessment of\ncervical images captured with an ordinary smartphone. Thus, this study will accomplish the following Specific\nAims:\nSpecific Aim 1: To estimate the test performance of self- and provider- collected modified\nAmpFire\u00ae screening platform in Honduras; Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the feasibility of a single visit\napproach using a self-sampled modified AmpFire\u00ae screening platform; Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the\ncost-effectiveness of the same-day screen-and-treat approach using the modified AmpFire\u00ae test\nfollowed by triage with Automated Visual Evaluation (AVE) versus the current strategy in Honduras."

        "Abstract": "SUMMARY\nWith the increasing number of protein therapeutic candidates, identifying and isolating single-cell derived\ncolonies is a critical step that is conducted routinely and frequently in monoclonal antibody drug development\nand manufacture. Single cell technologies in cell line development (CLD) has gone through a few stages: first to\nplace single-cells in wells by limiting dilution, then to use FACS, and more recently, to place high proliferation\nrate single-cells into wells of a microtiter plate, aided by time lapsed imaging and robotic tools. However, no\nsystem to date can identify and isolate those \u201chigh performance\u201d cells, judged by cell proliferation rate and drug\nprotein production rate at Day Zero.\nWe propose to develop an innovative tool that can predict cell outgrowth characteristics immediately after genetic\nmodification based on high throughput 2D\/3D cell image and artificial intelligence (AI). The benefits of the system\ninclude: 1) shorten the time to clone selection from 6 weeks to 2-3 days, 2) increase the number of valuable\nclones analyzed by 50 times (from 200 to 10,000). These benefits will save drug companies hundreds of\nmillions of dollars, and potentially save thousands of lives in the case of protein-based vaccine production.\nOur proposed tool possesses several unique capabilities, including (i) a 3D imaging flow cytometer (3D-IFC)\nto acquire 3D scattering and 2D transmission images (plus 3D images of up to 6 fluorescent colors) of\neach single cell, (ii) a cell placement module that places cells exiting the 3D IFC for subsequent outgrowth or\ngenetic analysis, and (iii) convolutional neural network to classify individual cells immediately (Day Zero)\ninto high-performance and average performance cells, healthy and diseased cells, cells of different phenotypes,\nnormal and cancer cells, and different cell types. With these capabilities, our proposed system holds the promise\nof identifying the high performing cells at Day Zero in a unprecedent speed and throughput for CLD.\nThe proposed tool and technique contain the following innovative features: (a) recording of 2D and 3D cell\nimages on-the-fly to produce over 100K high information content single-cell images in lt 20 minutes, (b)\ndepositing every single cell exiting the imaging system onto a cell placement platform (CPP) consisting of a\nmicrocapillary array on a solid culture medium plate to keep each cell in a friendly and indexed environment, (c)\nusing bioinformatic tools to detect any cell deletion and misplacement errors to assure high accuracy of mapping\ncell images to cell positions, and (d) using a fused convolutional neural network (f-CNN) from both 2D and 3D\nlabelled and\/or label-free images to classify cells. Besides CLD, the proposed tool can benefit drug discovery,\npersonalized medicine, and fundamental biomedical research such as cell type\/cell atlas discovery and spatial\nbiology."

        "Abstract": "Project Summary\nPhase II: Functional drug fingerprinting with all-optical electrophysiology\nQ-State Biosciences has developed a therapeutic discovery platform that uniquely integrates i) scalable human\ncellular models of disease states, ii) diverse readouts of neuronal function using proprietary all-optical\nelectrophysiology called OptopatchTM, and iii) artificial intelligence\/machine learning (AI\/ML) analytics to establish\nunique, disease-relevant phenotypes for assessment of therapeutics. Optopatch simultaneously records rt500\nelectrical activity parameters from hundreds of neurons with 1 millisecond temporal resolution, single-cell spatial\nresolution, and a throughput rt20,000-fold higher than manual patch clamp. Leveraging this high-throughput,\nhigh-content data, Q-State has developed \u201cdrug fingerprinting\u201d (DFP) algorithms to learn the archetypal patterns\nof changes induced by disease states and chemical compounds, building a map of the functional\nelectrophysiology of human neurons. In Phase I, we populated this map with fingerprints of 400 diverse and\nselective tool compounds for a wide range of hand-curated molecular targets, which serve as landmarks for\ninterpreting the functional effects of disease states and novel chemical compounds. We also demonstrated that\nthis technology could identify a disease phenotype in neurons and predict drug rescue. In Phase II, we will\nadvance the DFP platform in 3 ways: 1) Build tools to improve the reliability, interpretability, accessibility, and\nautomation of the technology. Our current platform is capable of extracting data from Optopatch assays and\nfingerprinting the impacts of perturbations using representation-learning. To achieve a production-ready pipeline,\n\u201cexplainable AI\u201d techniques will be used to track how the algorithms make choices, and unit tests will affirm the\ncorrectness of all modules. The pipeline will be automated and deployed for access by non-coders. Finally, a\nnew set of modules will extend DFP to high-content imaging data for mapping biological states across form and\nfunction of neurons. 2) Expand DFP library to include clinically relevant compounds and additional neuronal\nsubtypes. To enable therapeutic discovery applications, we will expand our reference database to include a new\ncustom-assembled library of ~3,000 clinically relevant drugs, including a comprehensive set of approved\ncompounds, as well as unapproved bioactive molecules with acceptable safety profiles and favorable drug-like\nproperties. Scaling to a 384-well format assay, we will collect data for all compounds in human iPSC-derived\nexcitatory and inhibitory neurons, measuring pharmacological impact on both neuronal excitability and cell\nmorphology in a dose-dependent format to create unique multi-modal fingerprints. 3) Demonstrate\npharmacological rescue of a monogenic epilepsy in vitro and in vivo. As a proof-of-concept demonstration of the\nDFP platform, we will use our new database to identify compounds with potential to rescue effects of epilepsy\ncausing mutations. Putative in silico hits will be experimentally tested and pharmacological rescue of phenotypes\nwill be quantified. The best compounds will be advanced to in vivo testing in a rodent model as an initial\ndemonstration of the ability of the platform to rapidly identify new, clinically viable treatments for epilepsy."

        "Abstract": "More than 5 million patients are admitted annually to United States ICUs with average mortality rate reported\nranging from 8-19%, or about 500,000 deaths annually. Sepsis is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality,\nwhere one in three inpatient deaths are due to sepsis. Incidence of sepsis has been increasing with 1.7 million\nsepsis cases and 270,000 deaths per year. Early identification of deterioration has been shown to reduce the\nneed for patient transfer to higher care units, reduce lengths of stay, and improve survival rates. Each hour of\ndelay in ICU admission has been associated with a 1.5% increased risk of ICU death and a 1% increase in risk\nof hospital death. Many studies support that there is an increase in mortality rate for every hour delay in\nantibiotics. Pairing patient risk stratification with appropriate levels of hospital intervention is essential to reduce\nrisk of mortality. Patients in intermediate units between the levels of monitoring found in floor units and ICUs are\nespecially difficult to predict possibility of condition deterioration. Automated monitoring, alerts, and trend\nanalysis are essential to identifying and proactively intervening patients under duress. Current methods of\nmonitoring patient health have low specificity and have significant room for improvement.This project will develop Deep-CDS, a cloud-based deep learning system for context-sensitive clinical\ndecision support in monitoring and predicting the deterioration of patient health and progression of sepsis risk\nfactors in real-time to improve outcomes and optimize the management of care across the hospital population.\nTo support the clinical care team, Deep-CDS provides team members with (a) a clinical care knowledgebase,\n(b) an early warning score for deteriorating health conditions, (c) a model for predicting septic conditions, (d)\nevidence-based clinical practice guidelines, and (e) visualization of patient health status trends. Deep-CDS\naddresses NIGMS Priorities for Small Business Development of Sepsis Diagnostics and Therapeutics, NOT-GM-20-\n028: 1) Diagnostic tools for emergency department settings; 2) Predictive clinical algorithms and point-of-care\ndiagnostics; 3) Technologies that combine various types of data for diagnosis of sepsis patients; and 4) Clinical\ndecision support, including use of artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches, to develop tools for early\nrecognition of sepsis, assessment of treatment responses and patient deterioration, and long-term prognosis\nprediction in various care settings."

        "Abstract": "Project SummaryThe goal of this Phase I project is to render a proprietary artificial intelligence algorithm for sepsis\nprediction developed by Patchd, Inc., compatible with explainability capabilities, providing clinicians underlying\nreasons for increased disease risk, as opposed to a \u201cblack box\u201d risk prediction alone. The algorithm is\nadditionally innovative in that it imputes sepsis risk based on vital sign data gathered from wearable devices,\nproviding constant real-time surveillance of high-risk patients at home without requiring in-patient monitoring.\nSepsis has a high mortality rate of approximately 40% and often occurs in immunocompromised patients such\nas those undergoing cancer chemotherapy, organ transplant surgery, or treatment for autoimmune conditions.\nCatching the condition early remains the best way to reduce mortality as well as prevent the long-term health\neffects associated with post-sepsis syndrome, which occurs in up to 50% of sepsis patients. Artificial intelligence\n(AI) represents an intriguing means of identifying sepsis early. By compiling vital sign data from high-risk patients\nand analyzing any changes in real-time, machine learning algorithms have shown promise in identifying at-risk\npatients up to 8 hours before sepsis onset in hospital settings. While these predictive algorithms demonstrate\nthe power of AI in patient monitoring, most high-risk patients are treated via out-patient care without constant\nvital sign monitoring. Patchd, Inc. has developed an AI algorithm for sepsis prediction which employs vital sign\ndata generated using wearable devices, such as watches or patches which record patient data in real-time. Thus\nfar, the algorithm has been shown to improve sepsis prediction accuracy and provide earlier warnings for sepsis\nonset compared to other scoring methods. Recently however, bioethicists and regulators have called for AI\nalgorithms to pair their predictions with supporting explanatory information providing both clinicians and patients\nmore transparency when considering treatment options. During this Phase I program, Patchd will employ its\ncurrent algorithm architecture and add so-called explainability functions, revealing to the user which specific vital\nsign dynamics impacted a given prediction. Vital sign data will be analyzed for local explanation functionality\nusing both kernel and deep SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Data will also be analyzed to evaluate the\nsignificance of data points over time, using attentional mechanisms to understand the importance of vital sign\nchanges over time. Primary human data sets, comprising true-positives, true-negatives, false-positives, and\nfalse-negatives, will be tested using the algorithm to evaluate both its predictive and explainabilty capabilities.\nGiven that sepsis impacts 1.7 million Americans each year, the Patchd approach to explainable sepsis prediction\nwill address a large and growing market opportunity."

        "Abstract": "PROJECT SUMMARY. The economic and social burden of the treatment of infectious and\nchronic diseases is enormous, rt$300B annually. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic alone will\ncost the U.S. economy roughly $8 trillion over the next decade without an effective drug to date.\nThe emergence of drug resistant microbes, the diminishing supply of novel classes of antibiotics,\nand the dramatic reduction in RandD of anti-infective, anti-proliferation and anti-inflammatory\nagents have further amplified public health concerns. Fungi are prolific producers of anti-\nmicrobial secondary metabolites (SM) and since the turn of the century have provided 45% of\nbioactive molecules from all microbial sources. However, environmental filamentous fungi and\nfungal SM biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) remain largely untapped due to difficulties in\nefficiently handling and expressing these SM BGCs. This research proposal will advance the\nscience of functional SM metagenomics, and will further advance our newly-developed fungal\nartificial chromosome (FAC) technology by integrating Next-Gen Sequencing (NGS), artificial\nintelligence (AI), FAC heterologous expression, and direct Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)\nanalysis. Our methodologies enable precise capture of full-length SM BGCs from any fungus,\nand heterologous expression of large intact silent SM BGCs-containing FAC clones for high\nyields of natural products (NPs). Our goals are to improve the prediction of novel BGCs and\ntheir compound production, and to discover novel NPs for clinical development of novel\nantibiotics and other drug leads. In proof-concept research, we successfully predicted and\ncaptured the FAC-BGC of novel antibiotic berkeleylactone A and 136 BGCs from two different\nfungi by FAC-NGS. Phenomenally, we achieved at least 60% yields of discreet NP compounds\nas FAC crude extracts by heterologous expression of 5 of 17 BGC-FACs. We also elucidate the\nstructures of 15 NP molecules with diverse activities, including TWO novel compounds by direct\nNMR analysis of FAC crude extracts, due to the high yield of some compounds. In this Phase II\nstudy, we will further improve our in-house FAC-NGS-AI pipeline to better predict novel fungal\nBGCs and their NPs, increasing the compound hit rate to 50~70% with high yield. We will\ncompletely dissect the berkeleylactone BGC and discover novel derivatives of this new antibiotic\nof homologous BGCs of other fungi. We will also study twelve fungi (ten fungi with no reference\ngenomic sequences available) with an estimated 800 BGCs. This technology should improve\nfungal SM discovery 100~1000 fold and result in the discovery of at least five novel antibiotics,\nand other drug leads from un-studied\/un-sequenced fungi of the toxic Berkeley Pit."

        "Abstract": "More than 1 in 4 people 65 and older fall each year, leading to more than $50 billion in annual spending for treatment,\nand on an upward trajectory. Exercise programs are proven to reduce fall risk for older adults, by improving muscle\nstrength, balance, and gait instabilities. Fall prevention programs are encouraged by the CDC, NIA, and many other\norganizations, and are often provided by community-based organizations and other institutions. While fall prevention\nprograms are an effective intervention, the impact of current programs is mitigated by cost to administer, lack of\nscalability, inability to reach underserved populations, lack of encouragement of ongoing usage, and inability to track\nadherence and health outcomes in a systematic way. Older adults are typically unaware of proper exercise regimens for\ntheir specific needs. Currently, the project team believes no fall prevention programs -- either at community centers,\nother establishments, or at home -- are delivered nationally, affordably delivered, and efficiently administered to broad\npopulations that achieve adherence with effective outcomes. KINIMA Inc., is a women-owned company incorporated in\n2016 and incubated in both University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton Venture Initiative Program and Stanford University\u2019s\nStartX and commercially offered. THE KINIMA Seniors latest offering is a ground-breaking, novel technology that uses\ncomputer vision with no on-body sensors, an innovative side-by-side view through augmented reality guidance with\nproprietary content, body joint tracking and artificial intelligence, plus multiple forms of feedback to provide a digital\n2-way comprehensive fall prevention exercise platform.The proposed Phase I study seeks to determine the KINIMA\nSeniors mobile phone motion tracking platform\u2019s feasibility, acceptability, and accuracy to support fall prevention in\ncommunity-based settings. To that end, project AIMS are: 1) evaluate KINIMA Seniors acceptability, engagement and\ncapability for subjects to complete sessions with little or no intervention by human staff; 2) determine specific forms of\ncontent that best promote the desired physical movement among the targeted populations, including: guided exercises,\nmovements, video genres, assessments, feedback, gamification and rewards; and 3) determine the effectiveness of the\nKINIMA technology for automated tracking of participant usage and movement for supporting productive fall prevention\nactivities with widely accepted fall risk measures. The KINIMA automated assessments will be compared against tracking\nby a human, which is the approach taken by most clinicians today to assess fall risk. These AIMS support the NIA\u2019s\nmission and research priorities focused on helping senior adults age in place through the use of assistive devices and\ntechnologies. KINIMA Seniors assistive mobile application will support older adults, caregivers, and therapists in\nmitigating age-related physical challenges, particularly in fall prevention. Computer vision and augmented reality features\nenable real-time user feedback without wearables or other gear \u2014on-screen visual guide-rails, duration counting, and\nrepetition tracking; KINIMA automated tracking is done instantaneously and will be measured against tracking by a\nhuman to assess concordance. KINIMA Seniors has enormous commercial potential, and this Phase I study is a major\nmilestone along that path to commercialization and allows project overseers to assess user acceptability of the features\nand effectiveness of the automated measures. Phase II will continue with determining the efficacy of the platform in\nimproving fall risk outcomes through measuring progress over time."

SIDECARe\u2122 is set to improve research animal care at the cage level on a massive\ncost-effective scale by automating the collection of relevant data to enhance consistency and\nreproducibility of animal models. SIDECARe\u2122 will revolutionize monitoring the health and well-\nbeing of mice by being the first to categorize mouse ultrasonic vocalizations (mUSV). In this\nPhase-II application, aim 1 completes the integration of the continuous mUSV monitoring\nsolution into SIDECARe\u2122 devices. Aim 2 expands SIDECARe\u2122 Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nenabled classification capabilities to cover the top causes of research disruption. Aim 3\noptimizes the SIDECARe\u2122 system via beta deployments in the UAB vivarium workflow. Finally,\naim 4 deploys beta systems at external test sites for pre-sales trials. Tricorder\u2019s innovative use\nof ultrasonic sensors allows the sensor array to pick up mouse vocalizations and use them to\ninterpret health and social events in the cage.\nSIDECARe\u2122 utilizes a distributed approach to deployment of the AI algorithms required for\neffective segmentation and interpretation of mUSVs. The focus of the current AI algorithms for\nSIDECARe\u2122 is to detect conditions such as mouse pups in a cage, flooded cages, fighting\nanimals, and ulcerative dermatitis. The continuous acquisition of mUSV data across increasing\nnumbers of cages, however, represents a wealth of unexplored data available for future\ndevelopment of novel algorithms and new understandings of mouse behavior and well-being. Of\nparticular importance to the SIDECARe\u2122 system is to integrate continuous machine-learning\nalgorithms, which constantly evolve to better identify additional factors and trends that contribute\nto increased rates of morbidity and mortality. The recorded presence of specific environmental\nconditions (cage lighting levels, temperature variations, humidity, ambient noise levels)\ncorrelated with mouse behaviors are useful for studying research outcomes and\/or\nreproducibility."

        "Abstract": "Abstract\nThe goal of our project is to further develop the tracking scanning laser ophthalmoscope\n(TSLO), the Retitrack device, to enable widespread use of the technology for high-resolution eye-\ntracking for head injuries, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI)\/concussions. Phase I of this\ngrant enabled the collection of data from 50 patients who had recently been diagnosed with a\nconcussion both during their acute recovery period and upon clearance. Accounting for age and\ntime since injury, fixational eye motion metrics were able to predict individuals with prolonged\nrecovery (AUC=0.81; 95% CI: 0.68-0.93; plt0.001). The Retitrack brings an unprecedented level\nof accuracy of eye tracking to the clinic by using an image-based retinal approach resulting in\nmotion measurements with a sensitivity of 0.25 arcmin (~1 micron). Currently, this system is the\nmost accurate, fast and functional eye-tracking system used in a standard ophthalmic instrument.\nResearch has suggested that pupil eye-tracking technologies have validated the idea of using\neye movements as a biomarker of concussion, but the current eye-trackers available lack the\ncapacity, repeatability, and sensitivity to predict recovery in mTBI. The Retitrack device can\naccurately measure fixational eye movements (FEMs), quantify retinal saccades at an\nunprecedented level, and can become an emerging biomarker of mTBI prognosis. Furthermore,\nit can serve as an indicator of severity in the symptomatology of multiple other neurological\ndisorders. The Retitrack device as a concussive prognostic tool would be the perfect fit for Sport\nMedicine Clinics and the locker room for post-concussion recovery monitoring ensuring a safe\nreturn to activity and mitigating long-term consequences of concussion by guiding the most\neffective therapies. Further optimization of fixational tasks and the construction of innovative\nsoftware that uses Artificial Intelligence algorithms to automatically quantify retinal microsaccades\nwhich will lead to the improvement of predicting the recovery and\/or worsening of concussion."

        "Abstract": "The BRAIN 2025 report states that a major goal of the US BRAIN Initiative is &quot;Generate circuit diagrams,&quot; and\nidentifies electron microscopy (EM) as &quot;the gold standard for circuit mapping.&quot; So far EM is the only approach\nthat has ever delivered a connectome, a map of all synaptic connections in a nervous system or brain. After\nthe C. elegans connectome in the 1980s, the labor of manual image analysis prevented the EM approach from\ngeneralizing to larger nervous systems. Since then, labor has been dramatically reduced by progress in\nartificial intelligence. Humans need only correct the errors that remain in an automated reconstruction. Zetta AI\nwas founded to make connectomic image analysis accessible to any neuroscientist. In 2021, Zetta completed\nan automated reconstruction of a cubic millimeter cortical volume for the Allen Institute. This is one of only\nthree existing petascale reconstructions in the world. For the Harvard Medical School, Zetta also completed an\nautomated reconstruction of the Drosophila ventral nerve cord. These successes establish Zetta as a leading\norganization in connectomics. Zetta\u2019s image analysis pipeline requires significant engineering labor to operate.\nBased on our operations over the past two years, we have identified several opportunities for engineering labor\nreduction by process automation, including EM image ingestion, image alignment, and hard example mining.\nSuch process automation will help make connectomics accessible to all neuroscientists. Availability of neural\ncircuit diagrams will aid the discovery of connectopathies and other structural pathologies that have long been\nhypothesized to be associated with brain disorders."

        "Abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThere is growing interest in the therapeutic application of phage for treatments of antibiotic-resistant infections\nand gut microbiome-related disorders. Phage therapies have the advantage of potentially extreme specificity for\ntheir targets leading to very little in the way of off-target side effects when compared with traditional antibiotic\ntherapy. However, the identification of phage that target an organism of interest and determining host range\nremains a technical challenge. Host assignment for a phage typically requires laboratory culture of the organism\nof interest, a significant barrier when trying to target organisms which are difficult to culture, and introducing\nsignificant biases into the existing phage-host knowledge base. And like antibiotics, it is possible that organisms\ncan acquire resistance to phage transduction, limiting the utility of a single phage to treat an infection over time.\nFor these reasons it would be highly beneficial to have the ability to identify phage with potentially therapeutic\ntargets efficiently from an uncultured population of microbes.\nIn this application, we propose to develop a machine-learning based platform for the identification and\nassignment of phage and their hosts from metagenomic whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. Our approach\nleverages the unique property of proximity ligation sequencing, or Hi-C, to efficiently gather direct physical\nevidence of phage-host associations from mixed microbial communities. We propose to use this technology to\nassemble a large-scale, high-quality phage-host interaction dataset from human fecal samples, use it to train a\nmachine learning model to predict phage-host relationships from existing WGS data, and provide a convenient\nplatform for users to input metagenomic reads to receive phage-host information. This approach would enable\nthe identification of phage and combinations of phage to simultaneously target organisms that are otherwise\nuntractable through standard clinical methods from both existing and future WGS data sets."

        "Abstract": "Project SummaryThe goal of this program is to initiate commercialization of a mass spectrometry (MS)-based workflow for\nthe diagnosis and classification of membranous nephropathy (MN), a leading cause of nephrotic syndrome,\nleading to kidney failure in a third of patients. Since the 1950\u2019s, most forms of MN were considered idiopathic in\norigin, however, based on numerous publications in recent years, it is now broadly accepted that MN is caused\nby autoantibodies against approximately 20 different endogenous human proteins. The most common MN\nautoantigen is the phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R), and serological analysis of autoantibody titers against\nthis protein has proven to be an indispensable serological tool for monitoring disease progression, severity, and\nremission (1-3). Arkana and others have identified additional novel autoantigens in MN cases (4-9), and given\nthe success of PLA2R serological testing for personalized treatment, the characterization and clinical validation\nof the remaining MN autoantigens is urgently required. Furthermore, follow-up investigation of patients positive\nfor these newly identified autoantigens have been linked to life-threatening comorbidities including cancer and\nspecific autoimmune diseases. Because classifying patients based on MN autoantigen may reveal severe\nunderlying conditions, and PLA2R serology will identify only 70% of primary cases, Arkana has partnered with\nproteomics experts at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) to develop an unbiased, MS-\nbased approach to classifying MN of all antigen types. Phase I studies evaluated nearly 300 tissue biopsies from\nMN patients with previously determined autoantigens including PLA2R, thrombospondin type-1 domain\ncontaining 7A (THSD7A) (10), and exostosin1\/2 (EXT1\/2) (11), with triple negative cases also included. After\nevaluating a range of computational, statistical, and artificial intelligence data analysis modalities, ranked Z-\nscores were found to be an effective metric for autoantigen classification, correctly classifying over 95% of\nsamples. During the proposed Phase II program, Arkana will continue collaborating with UAMS to translate this\npowerful method to clinical practice and commercial availability. Quality control metrics will be developed for the\ninclusion\/exclusion of incoming samples, to ensure the reliability and repeatability of MS analysis and support\nverification of autoantigen classifications. The analytical pipeline will also be broadened to accommodate\nadditional autoantigen targets, many of which were identified by Arkana\u2019s recent MS analysis of hundreds of\nbiobanked MN samples. Finally, the method will be transferred to Arkana\u2019s CLIA laboratory and validated in a\ncomparative study with UAMS comprising approximately 300 blinded samples representing the full breadth of\nMN autoantigen classes. Launching this workflow as a commercially available service will not only offer clinicians\nunprecedented detail for the diagnosis and treatment of MN patients, but also reveal potentially life-threatening\ncomorbidities undetectable by prior generation strategies."

        "Abstract": "Project SummaryThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop an\nimaging platform to analyze lung biopsy samples at the point of care. The system will\nimmediately digitize unstained specimens and utilize computer-assisted detection\/diagnostics to\nenable quick and efficient evaluations of samples by pathologists. The broad, long-term\nobjective of this proposed research is to enable real-time diagnostics of pathology samples at\nthe point-of-care.Early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer is essential; the survival rate is low and is\nhighly dependent on the stage of the disease. Primary diagnoses through microscopic analysis\nof biopsies (FNAs) have a 20-40% failure rate due to inadequate specimens. As a result, repeat\nbiopsies must be performed causing delays in diagnosis and treatment up to 90 days, which is\nenough time for cancer to upstage and can reduce survivability by as much as 20%. Rapid-\nonsite (ROSE) assessment of the adequacy by a pathologist can guarantee the diagnostic\nquality of biopsies but is performed in lt10% of lung biopsies due to financial and operational\nbarriers.In this project, we propose to overcome the historical barriers to ROSE to standardize\nthe procedure for lung biopsies. This can be accomplished with two key innovations: (i) the\nApplication of a novel microscopy modality (coded ptychography microscopy - CPM) for digital\npathology; and (ii) imaging and automated analysis of unstained lung FNAs using Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) object detection algorithms. Preliminary work on thyroid FNAs indicates that\nCPM can produce super-resolution quantitative phase images (QPIs) with well-visualized\ncellularity on unstained slides. A multiwavelength compact prototype will be built and tested to\noptimize image quality and speed on unstained lung FNAs. After demonstrating reproducible\nhigh-quality images, object detection algorithms will be trained and validated on unstained QPIs,\nand will direct pathologists to areas of interest for quick analysis. Adequacy assessments made\nwith and without AI object detection assistance will be compared to demonstrate the clinical\nvalidity. The data produced in this feasibility study will fast-track product development and serve\nas the foundation for clinical validation. Successful completion of this work is a key step in the\nlong-term goal of increasing the availability of pathology services worldwide in a concerted effort to\nreduce cancer-associated mortality."

Physical andpsychological violence that is structurally mediated by systems of law enforcement, results in deaths, injuries,trauma, and stress that disproportionately affect blacks in the U.S. According to a 2019 study, published in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Americans\u2019 risk of being killed by police is highest for black\nmen, who face ~1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police over their lifetime. White men have ~1 in 2,500chance of being killed by police over their lifetime, and Latino men a ~1 in 1,900 chance. Women less likely thanmen to be killed by police. Their lifetime risk is ~1 in 33,000, compared to 1 in 2,000 for men. Moreover, blackmen, in the U.S., are up to 3.5 times more likely than whites to be killed by law enforcement; and 1 in every1,000 black men will die at the hands of police. In Baltimore, Maryland (MD), The Department of Justice (DOJ)revealed, in a 163 page report, that African Americans were targeted and abused by Baltimore police indicatinga conspiracy against black citizens. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates the overallcost of fatal and nonfatal injuries, by law enforcement, is ~$1.8 billion including medical costs and work lost.Public health policy experts suggest that mandatory training shall be implemented to reduce implicit bias oflaw enforcement officers against communities of color. However, little is known about effects of implicit biaseson behavior, and no experimental studies have been conducted to measure the impact of implicit bias reductioninterventions among law enforcement officers. Likewise, officers receive limited de-escalation training;w\/training efforts met w\/ resistance from police chiefs and national Fraternal Order of Police.During the NIH SBIR Phase 1 effort, Juxtopia team will address the aforementioned public health disparityto help mitigate the police violence endemic against black males by investigating the technical\/commercialfeasibility of engineering Juxtopia\u00ae CAMMRAD Police augmented reality (AR) goggles to distribute an artificialintelligent (AI) police e-trainer and e-evaluator, built upon the Juxtopia\u00ae augmented reality (AR)hardware\/software platform to achieve the following SBIR Phase I Specific Aims.A.

Early intervention\nof maladaptive family relationships is thus crucial for preventing or offsetting negative developmental trajectories\nin at-risk children. A variety of therapeutic methods have been developed and employed to foster positive parent-\nchild relationships and improve child mental health, including parent training\/education, in-person therapy, home\nvisiting, school curriculums, and web programs. However, systematic obstacles interfere with the accessibility,\ngeneralizability, and acceptability of these traditional appointment- and module-based approaches. Furthermore,\nlimitations in the family-centered flexibility, individual responsiveness, and broad availability of these services\nrender them inadequate to address the unique needs of at-risk populations who would benefit from more readily\naccessible and inexpensive 24-hour support that is provided in real time and real life\u2014when and where support\nis needed most. Not surprisingly, research finds that roughly half of the families who do participate in traditional\nappointment- and module-based mental health services fail to show sufficient symptom improvement. Just-in-\ntime adaptive interventions (JITAIs), in contrast, utilize smartphones, wearables, and artificial intelligence (AI) to\nidentify and respond to psychological and behavioral processes and contextual events as they unfold in everyday\nlife. Although JITAIs have the potential to transform the way people receive mental health support, barriers to\ntheir successful, wide-scale implementation remain. Using pilot data collected from smartphones and wearables,\nour interdisciplinary team of psychologists and engineers used AI to build machine learning algorithms to detect\npsychological states and contextual events, such as ongoing moods and relationship conflict, in couples. In the\ncurrent project, we propose developing and testing a JITAI to provide opportune supports to families in dynamic\nresponse to contextual events and shifting psychological states to amplify attachment bonds, regulate emotion,\nand intervene in maladaptive parent-child interactional patterns. Building on our prior research, we will (1) build\nsoftware to unobtrusively capture real-time data from commercially-available mobile devices, (2) use machine\nlearning to develop algorithms to automatically monitor psychological and behavioral processes relevant to child\nmental health, (3) launch a JITAI to provide as-needed intervention, and (4) carry out a micro-randomized clinical\ntrial to test the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of our JITAI for decreasing child internalizing and externalizing\nsymptoms. Our project will contribute to the development of technology ecosystems and service delivery models\nwith the power to meaningfully transform the accessibility and dynamic responsiveness of mental health care."

Expanded tasking includes the integration of autonomous and Artificial Intelligence (AI) sensors for manned and unmanned vehicles further expanding our capabilities and information gathering bandwidth. Sensor technology is not limited to information gathering, global positioning or data mining, but instead it is an ever expanding area of endless opportunities. Examples include automated take-off and landing (ATOL) systems for manned and unmanned aircraft, unmanned intelligence gathering and various communication networks. This Phase II effort specifically ties in with NAVAIR\u2019s Naval Aviation Enterprise (NAE) Sustainment Vision Plan (SVP). This prototype development will be a smart autonomous and AI based system that includes the integration and utilization of automated senor technologies for both optics and IR sensors.\u00a0 The DON and specifically NAVAIR are currently challenged with keeping up with re-painting and re-coating maintenance requirements for both manned and unmanned aircraft, as well as, their associated components."

        "Abstract": "In October 2020, HF Designworks, Inc. (HFDW) was awarded a NAVAIR Phase I Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contract titled \u201cMulti-Domain Data Fusion Instructional Strategies and Methods for Pilot Training.\u201d During this Phase I effort the performers created a Learning Management System (LMS) introducing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Multi-Domain Data-Fusion (MDDF) technologies that help pilots to maintain Situational Awareness (SA). Our desire for the Phase I effort was to create a Navy Future Vertical Lift (FVL) specific Concept of Operations (CONOPS) with the anticipated Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA)\u00a0platform and combine our backgrounds in human performance modeling, User Experience (UX) design, technology integration, LMS architecture\/systems, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to build a training tool for pilots where they could view Multi-Domain Data Fusion (MDDF) from various sensors including FVL\u2019s Air Launched Effects (ALEs).\u00a0\u00a0 The key goals of our work are\u00a0to teach the pilot to: 1) understand and trust the information that is\u00a0being fused and presented, and 2) better understand how to work with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and autonomous systems to achieve better Situational Awareness (SA) and combat effectiveness. Our platform drives continual and iterative improvement of autonomous systems, as well as overall human\/AI teaming success as we move toward the launch of FVL platforms.\u00a0 During our Phase I effort, we constructed a CONOPS around an Integrated Air Defense System (IADS) Breach mission where two FLRAA were tasked with entering into a near-peer adversarial city with known advanced Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAM) to drop off a Sea, Air, and Land (SEAL) team. The SEAL team was tasked with looking for a High Value Target (HVT). Our human performance models of FARA missions and now FLRAA missions confirmed that areas of highest workload for such a mission type were when the pilot (for single crew missions) or the copilot (in missions where we modeled a two-person crew) had to perform their traditional tasks as well as supervise the ALEs.\u00a0 Recognizing these periods of highest workload, we created our Phase I LMS around the operation of ALEs to include the data feeds they provide and the support of AI which would be needed to bring workload down to acceptable (i.e., manageable) levels. While our initial Phase I LMS walks the pilot through a portion of the mission, our Phase II goal is to develop an LMS that provides preparation - and pilot performance measurement - throughout all phases of the mission and pilot training, and - critically \u2013 introduces the ability to progressively train and improve the AI\/autonomous capabilities which support the pilot. In the course of Phase II we will also automate mission creation tools, enabling us to quickly support the simulation of a variety of missions, platforms, and user types, from a student Naval Aviator to combat pilot."

This goal is accomplished by integrating experimental data with data-driven modeling and analysis based on the Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Network Artificial Intelligence (HiDeNN-AI) technology. HiDeNN-AI provides a structured methodology of mechanistic data science (MDS) that develops accurate reduced-order models at multiple scales by integrating data science with mechanistic principles discovered using neural network. To address the key challenges in evaluating the structure-property linkage in thick laminate composites, five technical objectives are proposed in this program for the Phase I base and optional period: i)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Develop a computer vision tool (HiDeNN-I) to characterize experimental composite microstructures with defects, and their digital reconstruction for further analysis.

(Phase I \u2013 Base) iii)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Demonstrate the capability of the HiDeNN-AI composite modeling tool on predicting local mechanical properties with uncertainties. (Phase I \u2013 Base) iv)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Develop a plan for validation and verification (V&amp;V) of the proposed HiDeNN-AI software tool with the experiments. (Phase I \u2013 Base) v)\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Extend the Phase I base for the elevated temperatures characterization, modeling, and demonstration. (Phase I \u2013 Option) The key deliverables of the Phase I project include an add-on package to the major FE codes for evaluating mechanical properties of structural composites and its demonstration for simple coupon configurations. Future Phase II efforts will be directed towards application of the HiDeNN-AI tool for quantifying and certifying critical structural composites parts\/components."

        "Abstract": "This proposal is to develop an innovative system for Opportunistic Selection and Waveform Adaptation (OSWA) to resist adversary jamming. Our team is exceptionally well qualified to execute this project. Perceptronics Solutions has decades of experience with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) that include applying these methods to cognitive electronic warfare. Our subcontractor Spear Research is a highly experienced defense firm specializing in electronic warfare systems. As electronic warfare systems become increasingly sophisticated, many current radar systems are vulnerable to electronic attacks such as barrage noise and deceptive jamming. The OSWA system leverages the flexibility and computational resources o modern software controlled radar systems to overcome these kinds of attacks. Specifically, OSWA uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to intelligently select and adjust jam resistant waveforms during operation in response to real time feedback of waveform effectiveness and adversary behavior. Phase I of this project will culminate in a proof of concept demonstration in which jam-resistant waveforms are continually adapted and modified to overcome electronic attack using a combination of expert crafted rules and reinforcement learning. The OSWA technical approach combines cutting-edge algorithms for machine learning with our team\u2019s extensive experience in signal processing and EW hardware systems."

        "Abstract": "The proposed Sirens system combines multiple TRL7-9 technologies currently in operation across the DoD into a highly capable RF sensor package capable of detecting, geolocating, and electronic attacking adversarial radar networks using a team of coordinated UAVs. The Sirens system leverages the Team\u2019s vast combined experience developing TRL9 hardware and software for electronic intelligence and attack with a strong background in AI\/ML and prototype integration for its development. The core RF expertise and capabilities not only directly provide a pathway to developing relevant RF detection, parameterization, geolocation, and electronic attack methods but also provide the ability to create high-fidelity training environments for training AI\/ML methods for detecting new signals and reinforcement learning based multi-agent coordination. To support the proposed Sirens concept of operations and a rapid prototyping environment demonstration at the end of Phase 2, the team will leverage its other existing capabilities including a TRL7 quadrotor with an ELINT package, a TRL9 high-assurance differential GPS system to provide precise geolocation of adversarial emitters, and TRL9 anomaly detection systems. Developing the architecture of the Sirens system will leverages the team\u2019s vast expertise in developing sensor and software systems for airborne systems, airborne control of multiple interconnected systems, modular\/open software architecture, data assurance, artificial intelligence, manned-unmanned teaming\/collaborative robotics, and machine learning. This collection of knowledge and experiences drastically reduces the risk associated with the development of the Sirens system for manned-unmanned teaming in a modern environment."

        "Abstract": "Effective application of Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) knowledge and skills during real-world tactical operations to engage task spectrum is a challenge for the Fleet. Operators are at different skill levels, and there are many different and complex operational displays, modes, alerts, communications, and system capabilities. The ASW mission demands vigilance during search; integration of concepts and dynamic data leading to detection and initial classification; succinct reporting; accurate tracking and enhanced classification; and appropriate evasion techniques or weapons selection, settings, and engagement. Sonalysts, Inc. (Sonalysts) proposes the Undersea Warfare (USW) Tactical Advantage Support Kit (TASK), an innovative framework featuring Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based agents that dynamically adapt to different individual skill levels and tactical situations in real time, deciding the most effective times and ways to offer assistance. Different frameworks within TASK will parse tactical system messages, update the tactical picture, track operator actions for different task threads, assess real-time operational effectiveness, and adapt the timing, format, and content of the just-in-time assistance presented to the operator in order to make their work less complex and faster"

        "Abstract": "Predictive maintenance (PdM) through artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is being widely evaluated and used across industries to improve standard maintenance scheduling and reduce time, expense, and downtime due to component failure. One area primed to benefit from an AI\/ML PdM solution is Standard Missile (SM) maintenance. The SM maintenance process produces a fountain of data, but current utilization requires extensive man hours to analyze and does not provide aggregated insights. An opportunity exists to apply AI\/ML advancements to the SM dataset, thereby optimizing SM maintenance strategies. Therefore, Design Interactive Inc. (DI) proposes the development of Aide for Missile Maintenance Operations (AMMO), a decision support tool that holistically optimizes SM maintenance strategies. AMMO will identify data for use in PdM modeling and prepare it for analysis. Then, AMMO will apply AI\/ML concepts such as anomaly detection, classification, and survival regression to provide actionable insights on SM maintenance and reliability to the SM Program Office. These insights will be displayed within an intuitive decision support dashboard, allowing an at-a-glance view of sustainment activities and fleet readiness to support SM decision making. Implementation of AMMO is expected to increase automation of maintenance planning, reduce life cycle costs, and increase fleet readiness."

(DI) proposes the development of a Phase II prototype for Asclepius, an artificially intelligent system for automatically interpreting combat casualty care scenes. Asclepius will be a force multiplier for combat medics performing prolonged field care, granting them more time to provide direct care and better access to data-driven decision support systems. Using a custom-built perception system, Asclepius analyzes medics, medical objects, and casualties in its field of view to identify what, when, and where medical procedures have been performed. Asclepius is hardware-agnostic, but the prototype will be developed to run on Microsoft\u2019s HoloLens 2 and an ATAK-enabled smartphone in Phase II. The final system will be deployed on the Army\u2019s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) and will seamlessly integrate with other military end-user devices (EUDs) and software such as the Battlefield Assisted Trauma Distributed Observation Kit (BATDOK), making it a completely hands-free solution. Critically, Asclepius will be designed to run only on the processing power available on military EUDs to facilitate its use in denied, intermittent, and low-bandwidth (DIL) comms environments."

        "Abstract": "Current weapon mission planners are tasked with planning increasingly diverse missions with complex next generation weapons and tactics. Planners must coordinate across various systems of systems, platforms, and weapons, leaving less time for each task. Their workload is immense and currently, not enabled by the JMPS system, because it was not designed to support the level of complexity, the limited time available to plan, and newer weapon types, like Network Enabled Weapons (NEWs). Fighter pilots plan in two hours or less, and bombers plan larger missions in eight hours or less. The system is not intuitive, requiring significant training and experience to become proficient with the system, every time the system is upgraded, additional training must occur and there is a significant dip in performance until teams become familiar with the updated software.\u00a0 \u00a0 Monterey Technologies, Inc. (MTI) and Tapestry Solutions, A Boeing Company (Tapestry), propose to develop a Next Generation Weapons Planning Software User Interface (NGWPS). NGWPS will provide a workflow-driven, task-based user interface (UI) designed to support rapid development of high-quality weapons plans. The UI steps will incorporate auto-fill, decision support, and full automation where appropriate, to reduce the cognitive load on the planner, and to improve the consistency of the results.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 NGWPS UI will also be instrumented using a novel model-based instrumentation that enables data logging of all interactions with the UI with minimal resource usage. The data logs will then be reviewed by an artificial intelligence (AI) engine designed to identify planning tasks that are causing the user frustration, rework, excessive time, or varying results. This analysis of user patterns will then feed back to the design and development of improvements, resulting in a spiral improvement of Weapons Planning System (WPS) to optimize the duration and results of the weapons planning process.\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "Objective: Sparta Science, partnered with the 37th Training Wing and AFLCMC\/WNU, intends to reduce the 31% of Basic Military Training (BMT) trainees who experience musculoskeletal injury (MSKI) and 20% of injured trainees who do not graduate BMT. Approximately 70% of these MSKI are overuse injuries (O-MSKI) that are preventable. Medical attrition from BMT costs the DAF up to $46 million annually. By providing healthcare providers scalable, machine-learning enhanced, objective metrics indicating trainee risk for O-MSKI, providers can prophylactically intervene to reduce the risk of training injuries, improve on-time BMT graduation rates, and enhance DAF mission readiness. R&amp;D Effort: Within the first week of each BMT class, Sparta will collect de-identified feedback and movement signatures from all trainees using its Sparta Movement Health Platform software, with follow-up scans at BMT mid and end and if an injury occurs. Through R&amp;D using ML model engineering, the collected force plate data and survey responses will enable the \u201ctraining\u201d and testing of ML models on the specific aspects of BMT O-MSKI, resulting in an artificial intelligence (AI) and ML-enabled software to aid in early identification of injury risks allowing healthcare professionals to intervene before injury impacts training."

By enabling Airmen with event-targeted,individually-tailored, self-adapting fitness plans, Airmen can optimize their efforts toward specific events, contributing to an overall improvement of DAF health and readiness. Such a capability will be foundational should the DAF explore an option to replace the conventional PFT with steady-state, automated individual fitness reporting\/monitoring. The resulting capability is envisioned to be a force-multiplier for DAF human performance practitioners. R&amp;D: Sparta will develop AI\/ML-enabled Fitness Test Improvement software platform (aiFIT) capable of automating adaptive fitness training plans per individual requirements and performance. The project plan includes periodic fitness tests and Sparta Scans by participating Airmen, who will be assigned fitness programs through Sparta\u2019s MOVE app on their smartphone. Each additional PFT, Sparta Scan, and training log acts as additional data points to evolve and improve the aiFIT ML models for PFT event preparation optimization. A subset of Airmen will include Oura Ring metrics to determine whether that additional data enhances their ability to improve fitness.\u00a0"

        "Abstract": "Military operations require fast, decisive, and accurate decision making to accomplish missions with optimal performance and minimization of exposure to risk.\u00a0 Military leaders are forced to make these decisions under constant pressure, changing circumstances, incomplete information, and very short time frames with minimal margin for error.\u00a0 Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, specifically, Deep Learning (DL) are helping train computers to accomplish tasks under these same conditions by recognizing patterns across massive data streams.\u00a0 Research in competitive gaming, especially Real-Time Strategy (RTS) games, have shared an interesting symbiosis with the advancement of AI approaches to complex decision-making and hierarchical planning. RTS games are characterized by their imperfect information, large state and action spaces, and necessary balancing of high and low-level planning. The conceptual underpinnings of these game dynamics are highly relevant to problems that are familiar to the military intelligence community, such as knowing how to parameterize plans and when to execute them. Partial observability of environments compounds these difficulties by adding a degree of uncertainty to the mix.\u00a0 However, a question that remains to be answered is how well recent accomplishments in gaming agents, can improve real-world decision-making aids that require situational awareness over high-dimensional observations. \u00a0DL approaches are making it possible for machines to learn from experiences, adapt to new data, and provide recommendations on optimal behavior. Insights from these models can be communicated to users and analytics providing an intelligence and command advantage. However, the lack of transparency and explainability have made it impossible for these decision makers to put lives at risk based on a black box opinion on the best path forward.\u00a0 In addition, current AI and DL solutions focus on individual decisions based on the current situation with minimal concern for longer term strategic impacts.\u00a0 To solve these two shortcomings, the Machina Cognita Technologies team proposes to develop the State-based Machine Aided Real Time Strategy (SMARTS) engine.\u00a0 The SMARTS engine will provide the ability to analyze an array of potential sequences of actions (or decision tracks), the risks associated with each of these actions, and the required capabilities and effectiveness for units to execute the actions.\u00a0 In addition, the SMARTS engine will provide clear explanations as to the reasoning behind the recommended actions, the impact on mission effectivities, and the possible outcomes for the recommended actions and alternative paths.\u00a0 Specifically, we seek to create a machine learning framework for distilling mission plans into interpretable strategic and tactical decision tracks using a combination of behavioral cloning, unsupervised learning, and attention networks."

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) are charged with preventing counterfeit product from entering the country. Counterfeit integrated circuits (IC\u2019s) and printed circuit boards (PCB\u2019s) are not always easy to identify. There is an opportunity for computer vision-based inspection utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to aid with the identification and ultimate rejection of counterfeit microelectronics.The proposed system will include both the handheld device and the backend system support in the cloud. The handheld device will provide a powerful first level of analysis of the IC or PCB looking for counterfeit attributes of reworked parts, etc. The detection CNN (Convolution Neural Network) can be downloaded for specific parts or catalog of parts based on having good training images.The VCED handheld device will be specifically designed to identify counterfeit electronics specifically for the needs of CBP and DHS inspection agents. Onyx thinks that there is a wider market for this same capability for any companies that are purchasing volumes of ICs and PCBs. This will be a useful system for circuit board assembly companies to inspect IC\u2019s prior to installing them on circuit boards.There are over 500 PCB assembly companies in the USA.There are thousands of companies that purchase completed PCBs could benefit by using the system in their incoming inspection."

        "Abstract": "Operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models frequently struggle with track errors for wintertime cyclones which can lead to life threatening impacts and economic disruptions. Data assimilation is an advanced statistical method for preparing relatively low-resolution, high-fidelity sensor information for these NWP models. This method produces a first-guess field that serves as an estimation of the current state of the atmosphere in operational NWP models, which ultimately produce weather forecasts that are essential tools for forecasters. Despite many advances in the field, shortcomings are still very apparent and NWP models still have prediction issues with common weather occurrences, including those that produce extreme weather. The very large data volumes and computational expense of imperfect data assimilation requires unique solutions to improve NWP predictions. With the advance of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), along with other techniques for processing large volumes of data, the possibilities for improving data assimilation are numerous. This proposed effort will take advantage of recent advances in AI\/ML in order to generate better initial conditions for NWP models, which will contribute to improved forecasts of extreme events. This effort will begin by gathering large amounts of data prior to and during major winter weather events to create training datasets for proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) reconstruction which will provide an AI\/ML approximation of the natural state based on the data collected. We plan to run NWP models using both traditional data assimilation and with POD dynamic modeling for winter cyclones. The new AI\/ML technique should present new approaches for future NASA model development and NASA computational groups."

        "Abstract": "We propose Configuration, Optimization and Management of DTN via Artificially Intelligent Decentralized Systems (COMMANDS). COMMANDS offers a decentralized AI-based solution to configure, optimize and manage communications for NASArsquo;s lunar networks. It will provide significant improvements in throughput, end-to-end latency, overhead and resource consumption in delay\/disruption tolerant networks (DTN) backed by our previous NASArsquo;s SBIR program, LEARN. COMMANDS is based on our tactical AI design and builds a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework that enables the lunar network to sense, adapt, act and learn from its experiences and unknown environment autonomously. This automates and optimizes mission operation and resource efficiencies without necessitating involvement from a mission operations team. We propose to deploy graph-based machine learning that enables neural comprehension of all available network parameters and conditions into a node embedding. Next, our tactical AI uses a hybrid approach to combine expert systems and AI to bring robustness and intuition designs.COMMANDS extends our Python-based simulation of DTN Lunar communication for the training, testing, verification. We further use the CORE network emulation tool to demonstrate the validation and performance gains of the COMMANDS as a novel network traffic management software service.We propose an alternative approach for training graph neural network (GNN)-based design. To efficiently train GNN, first, we find the centralized solution to the network routing, resource allocation and control, bundle scheduling and fragmentation. The centralized solution will be formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). We propose to solve neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) to solve this centralized problem. The outcome is a centralized solution, which will help us in the design of a decentralized GNN-based solution."

        "Abstract": "NASA needs enhanced high-performance space computing technology for future missions. Current radiation hardened solutions are power inefficient and lack significant computing performance compared to current commercial capabilities. Some modern technology or process nodes have inherent radiation resistance due to the fabrication methods; partially depleted, fully depleted, and FinFET gates; and the use of silicon-on-insulator. Combining processors implemented with these technologies alongside Space Microrsquo;s patented upset mitigation techniques, blind scrubbing, and execution checkpoints, yield a space-grade COTS processor with 1000 times more performance than current radiation-hardened processors.Space Micro proposes the development of a 3U SpaceVPX, radiation-tolerant, high-performance, reconfigurable single board computer (SBC) based on the Xilinx Versal VC1902. Space Micro has named this new SBC the Proton High-Performance Reconfigurable (PHiRetrade;) SBC. This SBC offers enhanced parallel processing and artificial intelligence power, much to the effect of a supercomputer cluster.

        "Abstract": "Groundwater represents about a third of global water withdrawals, and approximately half of global irrigation water. In many arid and semi-arid regions, groundwater is rapidly being depleted, which is affecting agricultural productivity over the long term. The over-exploitation of groundwater due to the current drought episode in South-Western U.S. has already led farmers to fallow hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland.Informed assessments and policies related to groundwater supplies can only be made on the basis of large-scale, precise estimates of depletion and recharge. However, current technologies have poor resolution in time and\/or in space. We propose to leverage very recent advances in artificial intelligence applied to Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) in order to study groundwater depletion and recharge. Variations in groundwater levels induce deformation at the surface of the Earth, which can be captured by satellite-based InSAR measurements. Our technology allows to lower the detection threshold of surface deformation in InSAR time series by about an order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art; the associated resolution in space is a few km with a time resolution of roughly a week, thereby potentially offering a new tool for groundwater management decisions."

        "Abstract": "VISIMO, a HUBZone small business, and University of Cincinnati will advance the verification and validation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) by developing a testing environment (TE) that supports certification through the evaluation of safety and stability of artificial intelligence (AI) models used for autonomous flight. Utilizing a 3D simulation, the TE will test complex sensor fusion and ML decision-making routines. This system allows for testing of non-deterministic, ldquo;black-boxrdquo; models by evaluating their performance in a realistic setting integrated with flight software and hardware. By carrying out failure modes in the TE, the certification tests can expand to include cascading failures in emergency scenarios, simulating rapid changes in operating conditions such as incoming storms, sensor failures such as obscured camera views, and hardware failures such as a bad Inertial Measurement Unit sensor (IMU). The high-level architecture of our solution contains a test management system. This system provides a way to design test suites, evaluate test results, and decide on further tests to pin down the complex, subtle failures that can occur in multi-sensor AI systems. The flight simulators that currently allow failure injection do not contain this useful post-test analysis. This test management system will also run parallel tests faster than real time, greatly surpassing the speed of current single-instance user-run tests. The purpose of the proposed Phase I work is to advance state-of-the-art to create a TE capable of certifying that complex nondeterministic algorithms used in autonomous UAS flight are safe for integration into the wider NAS environment; and (in Phase II) to subsequently develop tools to validate algorithms for prognostics, vehicle health, sensor fusion, decision-making, and cooperative planning using the Phase I TE. Phase I work will result in a technology demonstration and final report detailing the TE proof-of-concept."

        "Abstract": "NASA is seeking innovative neuromorphic processing methods and tools to enable autonomous space operations on platforms constrained by size, weight, and power (SWaP). To address this need, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes to develop an Adaptive Deep Onboard Reinforcement Bidirectional Learning (ADORBL) processor based on neuromorphic processing and its efficient implementation on neuromorphic computing hardware. Neuromorphic processors are a key enabler to the cognitive radio and image processing system architecture, which play a larger role in mitigating complexity and reducing autonomous operations costs as communications and control become complex. ADORBL is a low-SWaP neuromorphic processing solution consisting of multispectral and\/or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquisition and an onboard computer running the neural network algorithms. The implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning enables ADORBL to choose processing configurations and adjust for impairments and failures. Due to its speed, energy efficiency, and higher performance for processing, ADORBL processes raw images, finds potential targets and thus allows for autonomous missions and can easily integrate into SWaP-constrained platforms in spacecraft and robotics to support NASA missions to establish a lunar presence, to visit asteroids, and to extend human reach to Mars. In Phase I, we will develop the CONOPS and key algorithms, integrate a Phase I ADORBL processing prototype to demonstrate its feasibility, and develop a Phase II plan with a path forward. In Phase II, ADORBL will be further matured, implemented on available commercial neuromorphic computing chips, and then integrated into a Phase II working prototype along with documentation and tools necessary for NASA to use the product and modify and use the software. The Phase II prototype will be tested and delivered to NASA to demonstrate for applications to CubeSat, SmallSat, and rover flights."

        "Abstract": "NASArsquo;s Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) concepts envision increasing autonomy, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to maintain operational efficiency while ensuring safety. Increasing autonomy while maintaining or improving efficiency and safety will require effective teaming between humans and automation in routine and contingency operations. Concepts for highly automated future air transportation, like UAM and UTM, describe procedures for addressing contingencies, implicitly assuming automated services will be able to coordinate well enough to address contingencies, with little or no human input, if procedures are pre-defined. However, if traditional air traffic operations are to be a guide, humans will need to be involved in coordinated contingency planning for UAM\/UTM operations.To address the need for coordinated contingency planning in UAM\/UTM, we propose a Contingency Planning Toolkit for Advanced Air Mobility (CPT AAMO), whose architecture appropriately distributes work among system organizations and agents (human and automated). Its design is based on a systematic analysis of potential allocations of contingency planning functions. The analysis is not just about allocating functions between humans and automation, but also the allocation of responsibilities across organizations in the system. Metrics include function allocation coherency, operational tempo, and coordination load. The analysis enables us to assess each candidate architecture according to system properties like safety, resilience, equity, integration, and resistance to cyber-attack. Our approach allows NASA to move beyond function allocation to task design, providing a systematic assessment of what will and will not work as a procedure\/task. This effort fills a gap in AAM concept development, providing appropriate architectures and function allocations for contingency planning in a highly automated system."

        "Abstract": "The focus of the Phase 2 effort is to expand the Intelligent Machine Learning (IML) approach taken in Phase 1 to develop a Human-Centered Intelligent Virtual Agent (IVA). IML is an approach that moves the development of machine learning models away from engineers and puts the development of the model in the hands of the end-user. A Human-Centered IVA is focused on continuously improving the Machine Learning (ML) models while also providing effective communication between the human crewmembers and the IVA. Human-centered IVA is a perspective on artificial intelligence and ML that algorithms must be designed with awareness of being part of a larger system that includes end-users. This approach allows the IVA to incorporate the knowledge, insight, and feedback of the end-users allowing for tuning and refinement of the ML models. The Human-centered IVA will assist crewmembers in various tasks e.g., crew scheduling, procedure creation, and anomaly detection and resolution during a long-duration mission. ADAPT#39;s Human-Centered IVA will provide the computationally heavy-lifting while still receiving inputs and insights from the crewmembers. This allows for the expansion of processes and information to a larger scale without compromising data integrity or mission success due to a lack of ground assistance.To provide crewmembers with a Human-Centered IVA this effort leverages the supervised learning algorithms Decision Tree, Random Forest, Ada Boost, Gradient Boost, Extreme Gradient Boost, Categorical Boost, and Associative Rule Models which were shown in Phase I to be succesful within an IML approach. Additionally, this phase will focus on providing an explainable interface that allows the end-user to query the IVA for the reason behind its prediction. This will be accomplished using an interactive visualization Graphical User Interface."

        "Abstract": "NASA is seeking to supplement low-altitude meteorologic information to enable Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) service. AAM is a concept for safe, sustainable, affordable, and accessible aviation (e.g., passenger transport, aerial work, and cargo transport) both locally and intraregionally. The use of data from sensors that are not currently aviation-approved to identify local conditions along the route of transit, rather than making broad assumptions from sparsely distributed sensors, would allow for more effective use of the airspace, enhance safety, and improve operational efficiency by providing improved real-time wind, cloud ceiling, and visibility data. To address this need, Intellisense Systems, Inc. (Intellisense) proposes to develop the new Extraction of Supplemental Meteorological Data (EXTRA) system to provide fine-granularity weather data based on (1) direct measurement from low-cost, widely distributed meteorological sensors, (2) artificial intelligence (AI) data extracted from nonmeteorological sensors, (3) central data collection, (4) extrapolation of overhead conditions from ground conditions, and (5) go\/no-go determination based on safety criteria. The system will result in very fine-scale data to fill the gaps in legacy weather-sensing equipment in order to enable the emerging transformation of the skies that AAM will bring about. EXTRA operates on the principle of multi-sensory integration by which data sets from a range of disparate sources (such as direct readings from weather sensors or AI analysis of traffic camera imagery) are collected in order to synthesize a detailed map (down to a resolution on the order of 100 ft) and to subsequently extrapolate from that weather map to the wind field above the location of the sensors (i.e., winds aloft) and ultimately make go\/no-go recommendations. This technology directly supports the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD) AAM mission."

        "Abstract": "The overall objective of the project is the development of a sensor which we have named the Thermal Mapping and Measurement System (TMMS).nbsp; TMMS is a small, high performance, inexpensive, multi-band thermal infrared camera system, suitable for deployment in a variety of observational platforms. nbsp;This imaging system will be capable of mapping and measuring thermal features on the surface of the earth with a high revisit rate and high spatial resolution.The proposed prototype will deliver high spatial resolution, wide field of view, high signal to noise performance, and three or more infrared spectral bands.nbsp; The system includes near real-time onboard processing, using artificial intelligence and machine learning, to extract the information of greatest value, orthorectify the imagery, and reduce the size of the data for transmission.nbsp; This sensor system is designed to fit within the size, weight, and power (SWaP) envelopes of typical remote sensing aircraft and 6U CubeSats.The small size and low cost combined with near real time processing supports deployment of a constellation of sensors working together to provide high revisit rates, cross calibration, enhanced measurement and detection of thermal anomalies including wildfires, and coordination of observational assets. The flexibility of the design supports a multi-layered earth observation network including sensors in Polar Orbit (mapping the entire planet including polar regions), sensors in elliptical orbits (providing higher resolution and shorter revisit times over highly populated regions), sensors in High Altitude Long Endurance aircraft operating in the stratosphere (providing persistent observation over large wildfire incidents), as well as sensors in low flying aircraft (manned or unmanned) providing extremely high resolution imagery under the cloud layer.nbsp;"

        "Abstract": "Understanding a battle-space is fundamental to winning a war, and a Distributed Common Operational Picture (DCOP) is only the beginning of the required understanding. In this project we will produce a system called Artificial Intelligence Monitoring for Battle Space Understanding (AIM4BSU) to monitor the DCOP. It will provide watch standers with customized alerts and prioritized lists of targets. To do this, we will allow watch standers to express their goals and priorities by selecting from a list of objectives for war games involving units in a DCOP. AIM4BSU will use reinforcement learning from adversarial self-play to train AI agents to play these games. In real time, it will monitor moves the Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent for the selected game would make in the situation represented by the real-world DCOP. Watch standers will be alerted when the agent would make a significant move and techniques from Explainable AI will determine which targets and tactical situations prompted the move."

        "Abstract": "The RF spectrum is a dense and dynamic radio frequency (RF) environment. Traditionally, the limited number and relatively slow evolution of signals in the environment allowed signal intelligence, electronic support, and electronic warfare systems to emphasize specific signals of interest (SOIs) with little risk of surprise. Increasingly, civilian, commercial, and national users of spectrum compete for bandwidth using a rich and complex array of evolving waveforms, radio technologies, and access schemes. It is no longer feasible to know in advance how, when, where, and with which signals an adversary may transmit. Instead, new and unusual \u201canomalous\u201d uses of spectrum must be identified and evaluated alongside traditional SOIs. To address this need, we propose Osiris, an autonomous sensor processing framework able to detect and characterize previously unknown signals and spectrum use patterns, learn new signal detectors in the field, use RF fingerprints to sort and associate transmissions, identify emitter behaviors, correlate spectrum activities to build RF scene understanding, and optimize RF sensor tasking. Recent advances in the processing of RF spectrum using artificial intelligence and machine learning-based approaches have demonstrated their suitability to a wide range of RF processing tasks, from raw spectrum characterization to reasoning over large temporal, spectral and spatial scales. The objective of this program will be to develop and demonstrate a hierarchical RF pattern of life learning capability suitable to detect anomalies and other atypical uses of RF spectrum."
