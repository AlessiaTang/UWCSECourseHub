# Objectives

- Ensure the API functions correctly and returns accurate data.
- Monitor system performance to handle expected loads.
- Establish mechanisms for ongoing quality assurance and performance monitoring.
- Provide users with an up-to-date and efficient API.

## Functional Tests

### Endpoint Testing

- **GET /:** Verify that the root endpoint returns the welcome message.
- **GET /CSE312/23sp/**: Ensure this endpoint returns the correct JSON data from `CSE312_23sp_lecture.json`.
- repeat last step for every course content

### Data Accuracy

- **JSON File Integrity:** Verify that the JSON file contains correct and up-to-date lecture information.
- **Link Validation:** Check that all URLs returned by the API are valid and reachable.
- **Content Verification:** Ensure the lecture descriptions and links match the data in the source HTML.

### Error Handling

- **404 Errors:** Ensure the API returns a 404 status for non-existent endpoints.
- **500 Errors:** Verify that the API handles unexpected errors gracefully without exposing stack traces.

## Performance Tests

### Load Testing

- **Concurrent Requests:** Simulate multiple users accessing the API simultaneously to ensure it can handle high traffic.
- **Response Time:** Measure the response time under different loads to ensure it meets the acceptable threshold (e.g., <200ms for typical requests).

### Stress Testing

- **Peak Load:** Identify the maximum load the API can handle before performance degrades significantly.
- **Recovery:** Ensure the API recovers gracefully after a high-load period.

## Maintenance

### Regular Audits

- **Data Audits:** Regularly audit the courses' source websites to update the data in the JSON files, ensuring the data accuracy.
- **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

# Conclusion

This test plan ensures that the UW CSE course API remains reliable, secure, and performant.
