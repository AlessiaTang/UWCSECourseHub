# Existing Information Structure: has lower portability with respect to the original use case.

The existing information structure is basically the course calendar HTML file parsed from open-source CSE course websites, including lecture calendars, topics, and resources. The data is stored in HTML format, composed of a bunch of elements with different HTML tags and attributes. It is relatively difficult to find a lecture and its associated information (Findability: low). Access to the data is typically through web browser and search engine – first find the UW CSE course website, then the single course page, then the single course calendar HTML pages and finally the parsed result using Python tools. The process takes time and energy, and easily get lost. (Accessibility: low). However, the course lecture resources are annotated with rich metadata, using lecture type, lecture description, resource formats. (Interoperability: moderate). Within the parsed HTML file, the resources link data are subject to change according to the course modifications, which will lead to low reusability. (‘Reusability: low).

# Original use case: higher portability through multiple requirements.

My Product CSE course hub integrates the information and resources on the CSE individual websites to produce a FAIR data and resource management system. Data cleaning processes and validation checks are reequired during web scraping to remove inconsistencies and errors and to verify the integrity of the extracted data, ensuring accuracy and reliability. Individual courses and related resources are identified with unique API endpoints, which can be registered with URI for indexing (‘F’ and ‘A’: high). Course resources include the lecture title and hyperlinks, which can be opened on any device or system (‘I’: high). Resource links are extracted and stored on local with required regular updates for reuse through API query (‘R’: high).
